	<h1>Anton's OpenGL 4 Tutorials - Book Information</h1>

	<p>
		I try to collect all known typos and errors in the book and any known code
		problems here. I regularly update the online edition of the e-book as well as
		the source code.
	</p>

	<h2>Errata and Known Typos</h2>

	<p>
		I wait until a list of outstanding issues here gets reasonably large and then
		update the on-line volume. You may get a notification that you can update the
		e-book.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Reminder to call <tt>glUseProgram()</tt> before any calls to <tt>glUniform...</tt> in Matrices and Vectors
			chapter.</li>
		<li>"vertex attribute object" &rarr; "vertex array object" in several places.</li>
		<li>optimise early section reworded in chap2</li>
		<li>intialising &rarr; initialising - chap2 (3x)</li>
		<li>movment &rarr; movement - chap2 (3x)</li>
		<li>"log" variable names to "shader_log" and "program_log"</li>
		<li>Cube maps section "Sky Box" wording changed.</li>
		<li>Cube maps - "is called times" &rarr; is called 6 times</li>
		<li>Several small typos "a a" in Quaternions</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>31 August 2015</h3>

	<p>
		The latest version of the GLFW links against some new external libraries. If
		you are linking against the static build you'll need to update your Makefiles
		accordingly.
	</p>

	<p>
		Dynamic libraries on 64-bit GNU/Linux with C99:
	</p>

	<pre>
DYN_LIBS = -lGL -lX11 -lXxf86vm -lXrandr -lpthread -lXi -lXinerama -lXcursor \
-ldl -lrt -lm</pre>

	<p>
		Frameworks on OS X:
	</p>

	<pre>
FRAMEWORKS = -framework Cocoa -framework OpenGL -framework IOKit \
-framework CoreVideo</pre>

	<h3>7 August 2015</h3>

	<p>
		I got a Mac Mini and personally tested all the demos on OS X Yosemite.
		I updated the Makefiles to make Apple builds easier - you no longer have to
		uncomment the version hint section, it's defined in the Makefile.
	</p>

	<p>
		I found and
		fixed one or two bugs that only the Apple implementation picked up - the
		Kernel demo used an undefined shader variable, for some reason shader
		validation requires that a valid VAO is bound (!!), one or two shaders had
		keywords in the wrong order, and the texture shadows demo had some shader
		uniform location variables mixed up (that accidentally had correct values on
		other implementations!). The geometry shader demo was using a deprecated
		vertex count variable instead of <tt>gl_in.length()</tt>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Note that one or two demos are designed for GLSL 420, which isn't supported by
		Apple - I added some commented-out code blocks to make it easy to see how to
		retrograde these so that they run on OS X with 410.
	</p>

	<h3>28 January 2015</h3>

	<p>
		Added explicit <tt>glReadBuffers (GL_NONE)</tt> to 38_texture_shadows to
		protect against invalid framebuffer error on Apple. Note that this isn't
		actually valid in GL4 (seems to be from ES2/3).
	</p>

	<h3>26 November 2014 </h3>

	<p>
		Updated all the shaders' version tags to <tt>#version 410</tt> to properly
		support <tt>layout (location=x)</tt> keywords for attributes. The Hello
		Triangle demo is also updated to run OpenGL 4.1 instead of 4.0. I have not
		tested the Visual Studio demos yet.
	</p>

	<p>
		I also noticed that the texture coordinates for <tt>15_phong_textures</tt> were
		wrong, so generated a new mesh, and a new ambient occlusion map. I left the
		.blend file in that folder.
	</p>

	<h3>26 August 2014 </h3>

	<p>
		Updated the code for Extension Checking and the Debug Callback to use switches
		to get error strings rather than arrays, which were slightly wrong (thanks
		Kenneth!).
	</p>

	<h3>31 July 2014</h3>

	<p>
		I moved the demo source code to GitHub <a
			href="https://github.com/capnramses/antons_opengl_tutorials_book">https://github.com/capnramses/antons_opengl_tutorials_book</a>.
		Hopefully this will eliminate problems due to unreliable downloads from my web
		server.
	</p>

	<p>
		I have a few updates to make and small issues to fix, so expect this to change a
		bit over the next week.
	</p>

	<h3>4 July 2014</h3>

	<p>
		Found some shader calls to deprecated <tt>texture2D()</tt> and replaced with
		<tt>texture()</tt>. Also removed texture binding keywords from the
		<tt>#version 400</tt> shaders (required 420). Left a few shaders at 420 for
		comparison - note at top of shader files in question.
	</p>

	<h3>3 July 2014</h3>

	<p>
		My hosted server is occasionally <b>aborting downloads too early</b> - it might
		take a few attempts to get the files. Sorry about that - I'll move the code
		over to a reliable host after the holidays!
	</p>

	<p>
		Uploaded quite a few <b>Makefiles for Apple OSX</b>. I haven't been able to
		test all of the demos on Apple yet (I don't have a Macbook myself), but most of
		them should work! There is no Apple build of the Freetype library. I'll get
		there eventually!
	</p>

	<p>
		Found and fixed a bug in 02_shaders - thanks Andrea!
	</p>

	<h3>2 July 2014</h3>

	<p>
		The original code download was getting download errors (finishing too early)
		from my web host, Godaddy. Their support people said that it was too large
		(107MB), and getting time-outs, which I think is probably rubbish. I got rid of
		the protected download settings, which I suspect Godaddy was mis-managing. In
		any case, to get around this for now I have made the download smaller,
		and moved the Blender mesh files and Visual Studio project files into separate
		downloads:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a
				href="https://antongerdelan.net/opengl/book_code/book_code.zip">https://antongerdelan.net/opengl/book_code/book_code.zip</a>
			(30.3MB) - Main source-code download. Includes Makefiles.</li>
		<li><a
				href="https://antongerdelan.net/opengl/book_code/book_code_vs.zip">https://antongerdelan.net/opengl/book_code/book_code_vs.zip</a>
			(27.9MB) - Visual Studio 2012 Projects</li>
		<li><a
				href="https://antongerdelan.net/opengl/book_code/book_code_blender.zip">https://antongerdelan.net/opengl/book_code/book_code_blender.zip</a>
			(286kB) - Blender mesh files</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		After the summer holidays I'll look at moving all the code to a more stable
		host (potentially on Github or a professional source-code host). I'll also be
		revising my main OpenGL website so that the book is the main source of content
		for tutorials, and the site has articles for new and interesting things that
		I work on - I have Compute Shaders and some low-level optimisation techniques
		on my "after summer" list, powered by all the coffees that get :D. By all means
		send requests.
	</p>

	<h3>30 June 2014</h3>

	<p>
		I updated the source code download and revised and tested all
		of the project files. You should now find:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Linux Makefiles for 64-bit GCC for all projects</li>
		<li>Windows Makefiles for 32-bit MinGW GCC for all projects</li>
		<li>32-bit Visual Studio 2012 Solution for all projects</li>
		<li>Linux Makefiles for 32-bit GCC for some projects</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		I intend to add a set of OS X Makefiles, but I need to borrow an Apple machine
		first to make sure that they work properly. For now, this is the general format
		that you should expect for an OS X Makefile. Note the use of Apple frameworks
		for the OS libraries, as well as for OpenGL itself:
	</p>

	<h2>Fixes and Updates Made to e-book</h2>

	<h3>4 May 2016 (Edition 6 &rarr; Edition 7)</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			typo - Hello Triangle - Drawing - "to update things non-graphical events" &rarr; "to update non-graphical events"
		</li>
		<li>
			errata - Extended Init - Frame Rate Counter - "70Hz" is no longer true - all
			modern flat-panel displays use 60Hz. the next paragraph needs a clarification,
			and I should really suggest adding millisecond timers and mention GPU timer
			queries.
		</li>
		<li>
			errata/typos - Extended Init - talking about texture dimensions: 16384x16384
			etc. The numbers are wrong here - must have had much larger dims originally.
			The bit about not fitting into memory .: does not hold. The biggest size there
			(16k) is 1GB, everything else is just big.
		</li>
		<li>
			errata - Vertex Buffer Objects - "bottleneck is the bus" &rarr; "bottleneck created by queuing commands to send to
			gpu" (bus is actually very large)
		</li>
		<li>
			errata - Phong - explain why I did the <tt>dot_p = max (0.0, dot_p)</tt>,
			add it to the Blinn code sample, and add it to the Common Mistakes list.
		</li>
	</ul>
