	<h1>OpenGL 4 Shaders</h1>
	<h4>Anton Gerdelan. Last edited: 12 Jan 2025</h4>

	<p>
		Shaders tell OpenGL <u>how</u> to draw, but we don't have anything to draw yet - we will
		cover that in the vertex buffers article. If you would rather skip the introduction, you
		can jump straight to the <a href="#example_shaders">Example Shaders</a> and get them
		loaded into GL with the <a href="#minimal_example">Minimal C Code</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>Overview</h2>

	<p>
		Shaders are mini-programs that define a <b>style</b> of rendering. They are compiled
		to run on the specialised GPU (graphics processing unit). The GPU has lots of
		"cores" specialised for floating-point operations.
		Each rendering stage can be split into many separate calculations - with one calculation
		done on each GPU processor; transform each vertex,
		colour each tiny square separately, etc. This means that we can compute a lot of the
		rendering in parallel - which makes it much faster than doing it with a CPU-based
		<b>software renderer</b> where we only have 1-8 processors (in the graphics world, "hardware" implies the graphics
		adapter).
		Example:
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="images/shaders_2016_redo_512.png" /><br />
		<small><i>Common drawing operations such as transforming each vertex and
				colouring each fragment can be done independently. We write a shader (mini program) to
				compute these operations, and the GPU's highly parallel architecture will
				attempt to compute them all concurrently.</i></small>
	</div>

	<p>
		Shaders are a way of re-programming the graphics pipeline. If we wanted to use a different
		colouring method for the cube in the image, or have an animated, spinning cube, we could tell OpenGL
		to switch to using a different shader program. The rendering process has several
		distinct stages of transforming a 3D object in a final 2D image. We call this staged
		process the <b>graphics pipeline</b>.
		All of the stages of the graphics pipeline that happen on the GPU are called the
		<b>[programmable] hardware pipeline</b>. Older OpenGL APIs had pre-canned functions like
		<tt>glLight()</tt> for driving the rendering model. We call this the <b>fixed-function
			pipeline</b> ("fixed" because it's not re-programmable). These functions no longer exist,
		and we have to write the lighting equations ourselves in shaders. In OpenGL 4 we can
		write a shader to control many different stages of the graphics pipeline:
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="images/hwpipe2.png" width="512px" />
	</div>

	<p>
		A complete shader program comprises a set of separate shader
		(mini-programs) - one to control each stage. Each mini-program - called a <tt><b>shader</b></tt>
		by OpenGL - is compiled, and the whole set are linked together to form the executable
		shader program - called a <tt><b>program</b></tt> by OpenGL. Yes, that's the worst
		naming convention ever. If you look at the Quick
		Reference Card (or further down the page) you can see that the API differentiates
		functions into <tt>glShader</tt> and <tt>glProgram</tt> (note US spelling of "program").
	</p>

	<p>
		Each individual shader has a different job. At minimum, we usually have 1
		vertex shader and 1 fragment shader per shader program, but OpenGL 4 allows us to use
		some optional shaders too.
	</p>

	<h2>Shader Parallelism</h2>

	<p>
		Shader programs run on the GPU, and are highly parallelised. Each vertex shader only
		transforms 1 vertex. If we have a mesh of 2000 vertices, then 2000 vertex shaders will
		be launched when we draw it. Because we can compute each one separately, we can also run them
		all in parallel. Depending on the number of processors on the GPU, you might
		be able to compute all of your mesh's vertex shaders simultaneously.
	</p>

	<p>
		Because there is a lot of variation in user GPU hardware, we can only make very general
		assumptions about the ideal number of vertices or facets each mesh should have for
		best performance. Because we only draw one mesh at a time, keeping the number of
		<u>separate meshes drawn</u> per-scene to a low-ish level is more beneficial
		(reducing the <b>batch count</b> <i>per</i> rendered frame) - the idea is to keep as
		many of the processors in use at once as possible.
	</p>

	<h2>Difference Between Fragments and Pixels</h2>

	<p>
		A <b>pixel</b> is a "picture element". In OpenGL lingo, pixels are the
		elements that make up the final 2D image that it draws inside a window on your
		display. A <b>fragment</b> is a pixel-sized area of a surface. A fragment
		shader determines the colour of each one. Sometimes surfaces overlap - we then
		have more than 1 fragment for 1 pixel. <b>All of the fragments are drawn, even
			the hidden ones</b>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Each fragment is written into the framebuffer image that will be displayed as
		the final pixels. If <i>depth testing</i> is enabled it will paint the
		front-most fragments on top of the further-away fragments. In this case, when
		a farther-away fragment is drawn after a closer fragment, then the GPU is
		clever enough to skip drawing it, but it's actually quite tricky to organise
		the scene to take advantage of this, so we'll often end up executing many redundant fragment shader invocations.
	</p>

	<h2>Shader Language</h2>

	<p>
		OpenGL 4 shaders are written in OpenGL Shader Language version 4.00.9. The GLSL language
		from OpenGL versions 3 to 4 is almost identical, so we can port between versions
		without changing the code. OpenGL version 3.2 added a new type of shader: geometry
		shaders, and version 4.0 added tessellation control and tessellation evaluation shaders.
		These, of course, can not be rolled back to earlier versions. The first line in a GLSL
		shader should start with the simplified version tag:
	</p>

	<p><tt>
			#version 400
		</tt></p>

	<p>
		The different version tags are:
	</p>

	<table>
		<caption><b>Version Tags for OpenGL and GLSL Versions</b></caption>
		<tr>
			<td><b>OpenGL Version</b></td>
			<td><b>GLSL Version</b></td>
			<td><b><tt>#version</tt> tag</b></td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>1.2</td>
			<td>none</td>
			<td>none</td>
		</tr>

			<td>2.0</td>
			<td>1.10.59</td>

			<td>3.30.6</td>
			<td>330</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>4.0</td>

			<td>400</td>
		</tr>

	<h3>GLSL Operators</h3>

	<p>
		GLSL contains the operators in C and C++, with the exception of pointers. Bit-wise
		operators were added in version 1.30.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you leave out the version tag, OpenGL falls back to an earlier default - it's
		always better to specify the version.
	</p>

	<h3>GLSL Data Types</h3>

	<p>
		The most commonly used data types in GLSL are in the table below. For a complete list
		see any of the <a href="http://www.opengl.org/documentation/glsl/">official reference documents</a>.
	</p>

	</table>

	<h3>File Naming Convention</h3>

	<p>
		Each shader is written in plain text and stored as a character array (C string).
		It is usually convenient to read each shader from a separate plain text file. I
		use a file naming convention like this;
	</p>

	<table>
		<caption><b>My GLSL File Naming Convention</b></capation>
		<tr>
			<td><tt>texturemap.vert</tt></td>
			<td>the vertex shader for my texture-mapping shader program</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><tt>texturemap.frag</tt></td>
			<td>the fragment shader for my texture-mapping shader program</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><tt>particle.vert</tt></td>
			<td>the vertex shader for my particle system shader</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><tt>particle.geom</tt></td>
			<td>the geometry shader for my particle system shader</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><tt>particle.frag</tt></td>
			<td>the fragment shader for my particle system shader</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p>
		Some text editors (notepad++, gedit, ...) will do syntax highlighting for GLSL
		if you end with a ".glsl" extension. The GLSL reference compiler;
		<a href="http://www.khronos.org/opengles/sdk/tools/Reference-Compiler/">Glslang</a>
		can check your shaders for bugs if they end in ".vert" and ".frag".
	</p>

	<h2 id="example_shaders">Example Shaders</h2>

	<p>
		GLSL is designed to resemble the C programming language. Each shader resembles a small
		C program. Let us examine a very minimal shader program that has only a vertex
		shader and a fragment shader. Each of these shaders can be stored in a C string, or in
		a plain text file.
	</p>

	<p>
		In this case we just want to be able to accept a buffer of points and place them
		directly onto the screen. The hardware will draw triangles, lines, or points using these,
		depending on the draw mode that we set. Every pixel-sized piece (fragment) of triangle,
		line, or point goes to a fragment shader. Just for the sake of example, we want to be
		able to control the colour of each fragment by updating a <tt><b>uniform</b></tt>
		variable in our C program.
	</p>

	<h3>Vertex Shader</h3>

	<p>
		The vertex shader is responsible for transforming vertex positions into clip space. It
		can also be used to send data from the vertex buffer to fragment shaders. This vertex
		shader does nothing, except take in vertex positions that are already in clip space, and
		output them as final clip-space positions. We can write this into a plain text file
		called: <tt>test_vs.glsl</tt>.
	</p>

	<pre>
#version 420

in vec3 vertex_position;

void main() {
  gl_Position = vec4(vertex_position, 1.0);
}</pre>

	<p>
		GLSL has some built-in data types that we can see here:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><tt>vec3</tt> is a 3D vector that can be used to store positions, directions, or colours.</li>
		<li><tt>vec4</tt> is the same but has a fourth component which, in this variable, is used
			to determine perspective. We will examine this in the <a href="virtualcamera">virtual
				camera</a> article, but for now we can leave it at 1.0, which means "don't calculate any
			perspective".</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		We can also see the <tt><b>in</b></tt> key-word for input to the program from the
		previous stage. In this case the <tt>vertex_position_local</tt> is one of the vertex
		points from the object that we are drawing. GLSL also has an <tt><b>out</b></tt> key-word for
		sending a variable to the next stage.
	</p>

	<p>
		The entry point to every shader is a <tt><b>void main()</b></tt> function.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <tt><b>gl_Position</b></tt> variable is a built-in GLSL variable used to set the
		final <b>clip-space</b> position of each vertex.
	</p>

	<p>
		The input to a vertex buffer (the <tt>in</tt> variables) are called per-vertex
		<b>attributes</b>, and come from blocks of memory on
		the graphics hardware memory called <b>vertex buffers</b>. We usually copy our vertex
		positions into vertex buffers before running our main loop. We will look at vertex
		buffers in the next tutorial. This vertex shader will run one instance for every vertex
		in the vertex buffer.
	</p>

	<h3>Fragment Shader</h3>

	<p>
		Once all of the vertex shaders have computed the position of every vertex in clip space,
		then the fragment shader is run once for every pixel-sized space (fragment) between
		vertices. The fragment shader is responsible for setting the colour of each fragment.
		Write a new plain-text file: <tt>test_fs.glsl</tt>.
	</p>

	<pre>
#version 420

uniform vec4 inputColour;
out vec4 fragColour;

void main() {
  fragColour = inputColour;
}</pre>

	<p>
		The <tt><b>uniform</b></tt> key-word says that we are sending in a variable to the
		shader program from the CPU. This variable is global to all shaders within the
		program, so we could also access it in the vertex shader if we wanted to.
	</p>

	<p>
		The hardware pipeline knows that the first <tt>vec4</tt> it gets as output from the
		fragment shader should be the colour of the fragment. The colours are <b>rgba</b>, or
		red, green, blue, alpha. The values of each component are floats between 0.0 and 1.0,
		(not between 0 and 255). The alpha channel output can be used for a variety of effects,
		which you define by setting a <b>blend mode</b> in OpenGL. It is commonly used to
		indicate opacity (for transparent effects), but by default it does nothing.
	</p>

	<h2 id="minimal_example">Minimal C Code</h2>

	<p>
		Note that there is a distinction between a shader, which is a mini-program for just
		one stage in the hardware pipeline, and a shader program which is a GPU program
		that comprises several shaders that have been linked together.
	</p>

	<p>
		To get shaders up and running quickly you can bang this into a minimal GL program:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>load a vertex shader file and fragment shader file and store each in a separate C string</li>
		<li>call <tt>glCreateShader</tt> twice; for 1 vertex and 1 fragment shader index</li>
		<li>call <tt>glShaderSource</tt> to copy code from a string for each of the above</li>
		<li>call <tt>glCompileShader</tt> for both shader indices</li>
		<li>call <tt>glCreateProgram</tt> to create an index to a new program</li>
		<li>call <tt>glAttachShader</tt> twice, to attach both shader indices to the program</li>
		<li>call <tt>glLinkProgram</tt></li>
		<li>call <tt>glGetUniformLocation</tt> to get the unique location of the variable called "<tt>inputColour</tt>"</li>
		<li>call <tt>glUseProgram</tt> to switch to your shader before calling...
		<li><tt>glUniform4f(location, r,g,b,a)</tt> to assign an initial colour to your fragment shader (e.g.
			<tt>glUniform4f(colour_loc, 1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f)</tt> for red)</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		The only variables that you need to keep track of are the index created by <tt>glCreateProgram</tt>, and any uniform
		locations.
		Now we are ready to draw - we will look at drawing geometry with <tt><b>glDrawArrays</b></tt> in the next tutorial.
		To set or change uniform variables you can use the various <tt>glUniform</tt> functions, but they <u>only affect the
			shader program
			that has been switched to with <tt>glUseProgram</tt></u>.
	</p>

	<h2>Adding Error-Checking Functionality</h2>

	<p>
		The first thing to do is extend the minimal code with some error-checking.
	</p>

	<h3>Check for Compilation Errors</h3>

	<p>
		Right after calling <tt>glCompileShader</tt>:
	</p>

	<pre>
glCompileShader(shader_index);
// check for compile errors
int params = -1;
glGetShaderiv(shader_index, GL_COMPILE_STATUS, &amp;params);
if (GL_TRUE != params) {
  fprintf(stderr, "ERROR: GL shader index %i did not compile\n", shader_index);
  _print_shader_info_log(shader_index);
  return false; // or exit or something
}</pre>

	<p>
		I call a user-defined function here to print even more information from the shader. See
		next section.
	</p>

	<h3>Print the Shader Info Log</h3>

	<pre>
void _print_shader_info_log(GLuint shader_index) {
  int max_length = 2048;
  int actual_length = 0;
  char shader_log[2048];
  glGetShaderInfoLog(shader_index, max_length, &amp;actual_length, shader_log);
  printf("shader info log for GL index %u:\n%s\n", shader_index, shader_log);
}</pre>

	<p>This is the most useful shader debugging function; it will tell you which line in
		which shader is causing the error.</p>

	<h3>Check for Linking Errors</h3>

	<p>Right after calling <tt>glLinkProgram</tt>:</p>

	<pre>
// check if link was successful
int params = -1;
glGetProgramiv(program, GL_LINK_STATUS, &amp;params);
if (GL_TRUE != params) {
  fprintf(stderr,
    "ERROR: could not link shader program GL index %u\n",
    program);
  _print_program_info_log(program);
  return false;
}</pre>

	<p>
		I call a user-defined function here to print even more information from the shader. See
		next section.
	</p>

	<h3>Print the Program Info Log</h3>

	<pre>
void _print_program_info_log(GLuint program) {
  int max_length = 2048;
  int actual_length = 0;
  char program_log[2048];
  glGetProgramInfoLog(program, max_length, &amp;actual_length, program_log);
  printf("program info log for GL index %u:\n%s", program, program_log);
}</pre>

	<p>
		Where <tt>program</tt> is printing the index of my program.
	</p>

	<h3>Print All Information</h3>

	<p>
		One of the more common errors is mixing up the "location" of uniform variables.
		Another is where an attribute or uniform variable is not "active"; not
		actually used in the code of the shader, and has been optimised out by the
		shader compiler. We can check this by printing it,
		and we can print all sorts of other information as well. Here, <tt>program</tt>
		is the index of my shader program.
	</p>


	<pre>
void print_all(GLuint program) {
  printf("--------------------\nshader program %i info:\n", program);
  int params = -1;
  glGetProgramiv(program, GL_LINK_STATUS, &amp;params);
  printf("GL_LINK_STATUS = %i\n", params);
  
  glGetProgramiv(program, GL_ATTACHED_SHADERS, &amp;params);
  printf("GL_ATTACHED_SHADERS = %i\n", params);
  
  glGetProgramiv(program, GL_ACTIVE_ATTRIBUTES, &amp;params);
  printf("GL_ACTIVE_ATTRIBUTES = %i\n", params);
  for (int i = 0; i < params; i++) {
    char name[64];

	<p>
		The interesting thing here are the printing of the attribute and uniform "locations".
		Sometimes uniforms or attributes are themselves arrays of variables - when this happens
		<tt>size</tt> is > 1, and I loop through and print each index' location separately. I
		also have a home-made function for printing the GL data type as a string (normally it
		is an enum which doesn't look very meaningful when printed as an integer) - see next
		section.
	</p>

	<h3>GLenum Data Type to C String</h3>

	<p>
		This function converts a GL enumerated data type to a C string (for readable printing).
	</p>

	<pre>
const char* GL_type_to_string(GLenum type) {
  switch(type) {
    case GL_BOOL: return "bool";
    case GL_INT: return "int";
    case GL_FLOAT: return "float";
    case GL_FLOAT_VEC2: return "vec2";
    case GL_FLOAT_VEC3: return "vec3";
    case GL_FLOAT_VEC4: return "vec4";
    case GL_FLOAT_MAT2: return "mat2";
    case GL_FLOAT_MAT3: return "mat3";
    case GL_FLOAT_MAT4: return "mat4";
    case GL_SAMPLER_2D: return "sampler2D";
    case GL_SAMPLER_3D: return "sampler3D";
    case GL_SAMPLER_CUBE: return "samplerCube";
    case GL_SAMPLER_2D_SHADOW: return "sampler2DShadow";
    default: break;
  }
  return "other";
}</pre>

	<p>
		I only included the most-commonly used data types - I don't use the others so I just
		called them "other". Look up <tt>glGetActiveUniform</tt> to get the rest of the list.
	</p>

	<h3>Validate Program</h3>

	<p>
		You can also "validate" a shader program before using it. Only do this during development,
		because it is quite computationally expensive. When a program is not valid, the details
		will be written to the program info log. <tt>program</tt> is my shader program
		index.
	</p>

	<pre>
bool is_valid(GLuint program) {
  glValidateProgram(program);
  int params = -1;
  glGetProgramiv(program, GL_VALIDATE_STATUS, &amp;params);
  printf("program %i GL_VALIDATE_STATUS = %i\n", program, params);
  if (GL_TRUE != params) {
    _print_program_info_log(program);
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}</pre>

	<h2>General Conventions</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>
			All uniform variables are intitialised to 0 when a program links, so you only need to
			initialise them if the initial value should be something else. Example: you might want to set
			matrices to the identity matrix, rather than a zeroed matrix.
		</li>
		<li>
			Calling <tt>glUniform</tt> is quite expensive during run-time. Structure your program
			so that <tt>glUniform</tt> is only called when the value needs to change. This might be
			the case every time that you draw a new object (e.g. its position might be different),
			but some uniforms may not change often (e.g. projection matrix).
		</li>
		<li>
			Calling <tt>glGetUniformLocation</tt> during run-time can be expensive. It is best to
			do this during intialisation of the component that updates the uniform e.g. the virtual
			camera for the projection and view matrices, or a renderable object in the scene for
			the model matrix. Store the uniform locations once, then call <tt>glUniform</tt> as
			needed, rather than updating everything every frame.
		</li>
		<li>
			When calling <tt>glGetUniformLocation</tt>, it returns -1 if the uniform
			variable wasn't found to be active. You can check for this. Usually it means
			that either you've made a typo in the name, or the variable isn't actually used
			anywhere in the shader, and has been "optimised out" by the compiler/linker.
		</li>
		<li>
			Modifying attributes (vertex buffers) during run-time is extremely expensive. Avoid.
		</li>
		<li>
			Get your shaders to do as much work as is possible; because of their parallel nature
			they are much faster than looping on the CPU for most tasks.
		</li>
		<li>
			Drawing lots of separate, small objects at once does not make efficient use of the GPU,
			as most parallel shader slots will be empty, and separate objects must be drawn in series.
			Where possible, merge many, smaller objects into fewer, larger objects.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Possible Extensions</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Create a log file system, rather than a print-out system, so that you can scan through
			large volumes of information from each loaded shader.
		</li>
		<li>
			Larger projects will use many different shader programs. It would make sense to have
			a <var>Shader Manager</var> interface or class to load shaders, and to make sure that
			shaders are re-used, rather than loaded multiple times.
		</li>
		<li>
			In the future we will sometimes use geometry and tessellation shaders, so we can
			consider upgrading our shader functions to handle more than just vertex and fragment shaders. We
			can just set some boolean flags to true or false to indicate which types of shader
			have been loaded before attaching and linking.
		</li>

		<li>
			If you have a shader manager, and have written a function along the lines of <tt>setUniform(shader_index,
				value)</tt>
			from the manager, it could then check to make sure that shader is <u>in use</u> first (a common
			cause of error).
		</li>
	</ul>
