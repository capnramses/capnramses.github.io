		Web applications are attractive because they are an excellent way to <b>share
			your work</b>. All the user needs to do is open a web link. WebGL is a
		<b>browser-implemented</b> interface that gives web applications access to
		powerful <b>hardware-accelerated rendering</b>. No plug-ins or installation are
		required. WebGL is based on the mobile version of OpenGL; "OpenGL ES", which
		does not require the very latest graphics hardware, it's very portable, and
		will run on older desktops and most mobile devices as well. And, even better,
		you don't need to make a special build for each operating system. You will
		probably find WebGL to be several times <b>faster to create programmes</b> with
		than the desktop and mobile equivalents.
	</p>

	<p>
		I am going to explain how I made the rotating character at the top of this
		page, and introduce basic start-up, use of JavaScript, loading textures,
		shaders, meshes and file loading, and matrix manipulation.
		To avoid redundant tutorial content I'm going to assume that you've done at
		least the basics of modern OpenGL programming already - this means you have an
		idea about shaders and vertex buffers. I will assume that the reader is
		familiar with basic HTML, but not necessarily with JavaScript or newer web
		interfaces. <b>We will not be using any
			frameworks</b> or high-level interfaces, as there are ample resources for these
		already.
	</p>

	<h2>Technology Overview</h2>

	<p>
		You will find yourself switching between several languages when writing WebGL
		software.
	</p>

	<table>
		<tr class="border_bottom">
			<th>Language</th>
			<th>R&ocirc;le</th>
		</tr>
		<tr>

			<td>Write a web page with canvas rectangle to render in.</td>

			<td>Call GL functions, load assets using AJAX, handle user input, write main
				logic.</td>

		<td>Write shaders to define the style of rendering.</td>
	</table>

	<p>
		We will just write some basic HTML, using only one or two of the newer
		features from 5. JavaScript has a file loading interface commonly referred to
		as "AJAX" (asynchronous JavaScript and XML), as it was designed to serialise
		XML files into JavaScript object, but we will use it as a generic file loader
		that returns strings containing file contents. The shader language, with one
		or two very minor differences, is the same as that for OpenGL ES, with WebGL
		1.0 based on the OpenGL ES 2.0 specification, and WebGL 2.0 based on ES 3.0.
	</p>

	<h2>Basic HTML Skeleton</h2>

	<p>
		We can start by making a very simple HTML web-page.
	</p>

	<br />
	<div class="centre">
		<img src="webgl_images/canvas.png" /><br />
		<small><i>We start by making a simple HTML web page with a canvas area on
				it (shown in hatching). We will be able to use any other web interface elements
				to interact with our code.</i></small>
	</div>

	<p>
		The basic concept with WebGL software is that we write a normal web-page, and
		use the new HTML5 <tt>canvas</tt> tag to define an area of the page (a blank
		rectangle) that our rendering will draw to. You can use any of HTML's forms,
		text areas, and other elements to interact with your visualisation - we can
		say that we get a user interface library built-in.
	</p>

	<p>
		I started with something like this:
	</p>

	<p>
		<textarea rows="12">
<html>
<head></head>
<body>
<canvas id="mycanvas">
This text will appear if the browser doesn't support HTML5.
</canvas><br />
<small><i>

You can view the source code of the page to see how I display this.
</i></small>
</body>
</html></textarea>
	</p>

	<p>
		If you open this in a browser you won't see anything - just a space where the
		default 300x150 pixel canvas sits. We will attach a GL context to it shortly.
		To do that we add some JavaScript, which will talk to our web document.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="webgl_images/canvas2.png" /><br />
		<small><i>In our HTML, the canvas is a simple tag with a DOM id as a code hook.
				We can also provide <tt>width</tt> and <tt>height</tt> attributes to specify
				the actual size of the canvas on the page.
			</i></small>
	</div>

	<p>
		We leverage the DOM
		(document object model) to access web page elements from our JavaScript code.
		This is as simple as giving each element's HTML tag an <tt>id="my_thingy"</tt>
		attribute. The browser also has a BOM (browser object model) which
		provides built-in functions to handle user interaction <i>via</i> mouse,
		gamepad, or keyboard.
	</p>

	<h2>JavaScript Start-Up Code</h2>

	<p>
		JavaScript replaces C as the main interface language to the graphics library.
		If you've never used JavaScript before then you should know that it has nothing
		to do with the Java language apart from the name - it was a marketing scheme
		from a time when people still thought that Java was a good idea!
		JavaScript is a client-side script language, which means that a client's
		web-browser downloads your entire source code, then runs it within their
		browser on their own CPU. This means that you can do much more powerful
		interactive debugging, and it doesn't need recompilation, but it's a bit
		slower than C.
	</p>

	<p>
		We can add JavaScript inside <tt>script</tt> tags anywhere in the HTML
		file, put I prefer to put them all at the end, after my HTML content. Scripts
		support various languages through the <tt>type=</tt> attribute, but JavaScript
		is the default, and JavaScript blocks will execute automatically.
		You can add this script block to your page:
	</p>

	<textarea rows=16>
<script>
	console.log("starting WebGL");

	var canvas = document.getElementById("mycanvas");
	canvas.width = 512;
	canvas.height = 256;
	var gl = canvas.getContext("webgl");

	gl.clearColor(0.85, 0.85, 0.85, 1.0);
	gl.clear(gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | gl.DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
	// set some GL states that I want to use for rendering
	gl.cullFace(gl.BACK);
	gl.frontFace(gl.CCW);
	gl.enable(gl.CULL_FACE);
	gl.enable(gl.DEPTH_TEST);
</script></textarea>

	<p>
		I introduce a few new concepts here. The first instruction is the JavaScript
		equivalent of <tt>printf()</tt>. If you go to your browser's developer menu
		you can open the JavaScript console, and you should see the message. It's good
		to have this open whenever you refresh or reload your page, as it will give
		you quite good error information that you may not otherwise be aware of as the
		page may go on to look like it loaded correctly.
	</p>

	<p>
		I use the DOM to fetch my canvas element as a JavaScript object. Note that
		JavaScript does not use strong typing - everything is a <tt>var</tt> object,
		which I can tell you causes far more problems than it solves. In any case,
		my first action is to modify the canvas' width and height attributes from
		JavaScript, which should change its size on the page.
	</p>

	<p>
		Next, I ask the canvas to set itself up with a new WebGL context, and keep
		track of this as an object called <tt>gl</tt>. This object will be our
		interface to all of the WebGL functions.
	</p>

	<p>
		My final instructions use the <tt>gl</tt> object to call GL functions.
		They are almost identical to OpenGL function names and constants,
		except that <tt>gl</tt> and <tt>GL_</tt> are removed, and we access each
		through our new object. You can set the aplha channel here to 0.0 if
		you want to background to be transparent and the page background to show
		through. If you refresh the web page you should see the canvas bigger, and
		coloured. You can find the complete list of OpenGL functions on the WebGL
		Quick Reference card at
		<a href="https://www.khronos.org/webgl/">https://www.khronos.org/webgl/</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		You'll notice, reading the reference card, that WebGL does not support newer
		OpenGL's Vertex Array Object (VAO). It's actually quite tedious rendering in
		OpenGL without VAOs, as you have to set up vertex attribute pointers every time
		that you draw. There's a VAO extension for WebGL though. You can see it in
		<a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/webgl/extensions/">the extension
			registry</a>. We can query that in our script block, which will return a new
		object, which is then our interface to the VAO extension's subset of functions:
	</p>

	<textarea rows="4">
var vao_ext = gl.getExtension ("OES_vertex_array_object");
if (!vao_ext) {
  console.error ("ERROR: Your browser does not support WebGL VAO extension");
}</textarea>

	<p>
		If it isn't supported by the user's browser/system then we can use the error
		logging mechanism of the browser console to report that. This also includes a
		line number link in the console's output.
	</p>

	<h2>Loading a Texture Asynchronously</h2>

	<p>
		It's actually much easier to load a texture into WebGL than regular OpenGL as
		we don't need an image loading library - HTML already loads images. We can use
		an image that appears on the web page as texture, or load one quietly in
		JavaScript. Note that this is asynchronous, so the texture will actually be
		created some time later in your code after you provide the image URL.
	</p>

	<textarea rows="16">
var texture = gl.createTexture();
texture.is_loaded = false;
var image = new Image();
image.onload = function () {
  gl.bindTexture (gl.TEXTURE_2D, texture);
  gl.pixelStorei (gl.UNPACK_FLIP_Y_WEBGL, true);
  gl.texImage2D (gl.TEXTURE_2D, 0, gl.RGBA, gl.RGBA, gl.UNSIGNED_BYTE,
    image);
  gl.texParameteri (gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_WRAP_S, gl.CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
  gl.texParameteri (gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_WRAP_T, gl.CLAMP_TO_EDGE);
  gl.texParameteri (gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, gl.LINEAR);
  gl.texParameteri (gl.TEXTURE_2D, gl.TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, gl.LINEAR);
  texture.is_loaded = true;
  console.log ("texture loaded ");
}
image.src = "webgl_starter/heckler.png";</textarea>

	<p>
		That's it! Note that I did something really unusual, and set an
		<tt>is_loaded</tt> attribute <u>inside the texture</u>. We know that OpenGL
		textures aren't even objects - they certainly don't have attributes! In
		JavaScript we can <b>dynamically add new attributes to extant objects</b>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Because the modern web uses an asynchronous download model <b>we can never be
			sure when a resource will actually be downloaded</b>. On a bad connection the
		<tt>onload</tt> function may not even execute for a minute after your main loop
		starts. In the mean-time we will at least have a valid, but empty, texture with
		a flag to check against. In a C programme that was
		sophisticated enough to load files asynchronously, we would have a little
		set-up like this:
	</p>

	<textarea rows="7">
start_loading_shader();
start_loading_texture();
start_loading_mesh();
while ( !everything_has_loaded() ) {
  sleep();
}
// end of loading function</textarea>

	<p>
		We are not allowed to have a thread-hogging wait loop in JavaScript, so the
		best we can do is add an if-statement check in our main loop, so that it won't
		try to draw before all the required assets are loaded. For example:
	</p>

	<textarea rows="8">
if (texture.is_loaded) {
  gl.activeTexture (gl.TEXTURE0);
  gl.bindTexture (gl.TEXTURE_2D, texture);
  ...
  // draw with the texture
}
...
// rest of drawing code</textarea>

	<p>
		You can see why it's useful to inject some state attributes, and where the
		"popping-in" effect of resources we see in WebGL demos comes from. If you want
		to avoid this odd effect you could have a function that checks if all of the
		assets are loaded before rendering,
		and instead render perhaps some "loading.." text, but from my experience with
		a larger commercial project which had a lot of resource data to download, you
		can get a very bad user experience if they have to wait for a long time on a
		mobile device or on a poor connection - you'll probably find <b>users prefer
			"popping-in" to a long wait</b>.
	</p>

	<h2>Loading Shaders from HTML Scripts</h2>

	<p>
		I usually like to have my shaders in external files, but that's actually a
		little bit inconvenient in JavaScript, which will also want to load them
		asynchronously. For multi-part shaders it's actually an annoyance using this
		mechanism. You could concatenate both shaders into one file. You can also store
		the shaders in JavaScript strings. Most developers instead find it more
		convenient to put shaders in their own script blocks so that you don't have to
		worry about string formatting or asynchronous downloads. I put my vertex shader
		in its own script block above my other scripts:
	</p>

	<textarea rows="16">
<script id="heckler.vert" type="text/glsl">
attribute vec3 vp;
attribute vec2 vt;
attribute vec3 vn;

uniform mat4 PV, M;

varying vec2 st;
varying vec3 n;

void main () {
  st = vt;
  n = vec3 (PV * M * vec4 (vn, 0.0));
  gl_Position = PV * M * vec4 (vp, 1.0);
}
</script></textarea>

	<p>
		I set the <tt>type</tt> attribute to something appropriate-looking so that the
		browser doesn't think that it's JavaScript that should be exectuted. I set the
		<tt>id</tt> attribute so that I can fetch it later. The GLSL for WebGL 1.0 uses
		the <tt>acoderibute</tt> and <tt>varying</tt> keywords of older OpenGL 2.1 and
		OpenGL ES rather than newer <tt>in</tt> and <tt>out</tt>. Similarly, I have a
		fragment shader in a script block:
	</p>

	<textarea rows="19">
<script id="heckler.frag" type="text/glsl">
precision mediump float;

varying vec2 st;
varying vec3 n;
uniform sampler2D dm;

void main () {
  vec4 texel = texture2D (dm, st);

  vec3 nn = normalize (n);
  vec3 fwd = normalize (vec3 (0.0, 0.0, -1.0));
  
  gl_FragColor = texel;
  
  gl_FragColor.rgb = gl_FragColor.rgb * dot (nn, fwd) * 0.7
    + 0.3 * gl_FragColor.rgb;
}
</script></textarea>

	<p>
		We also have <tt>varying</tt> instead of <tt>in</tt> here, and the built-in
		<tt>gl_FragColor</tt> instead of an output variable. WebGL fragment shaders
		are required to have that exact precision statement at the top.
	</p>

	<p>
		To fetch the contents of these blocks as JavaScript strings, I do this after
		loading the mesh:
	</p>

	<pre>
var el = document.getElementById ("heckler.vert");
var vs_str = el.innerHTML;
el = document.getElementById ("heckler.frag");
var fs_str = el.innerHTML</pre>

	<p>
		I just use the DOM again to fetch the strings. Instead of a script block, you
		could just as well put your shaders in a visible <tt>textarea</tt>, and live
		edit them. Web elements have a range of <tt>.on....()</tt> functions
		that you can define. When a user clicks on something, or text is changed a
		callback function will fire - your function could recompile the shaders.
	</p>

	<p>
		Following this, I have regular-looking code compiling the shaders and getting
		some variables to hold the locations of uniforms. Note that I also explicitly
		bind the locations of my attributes to 0, 1, and 2, for points, texture
		coordinates, and normals, respectively.
	</p>

	<pre>
var vs = gl.createShader (gl.VERTEX_SHADER);
var fs = gl.createShader (gl.FRAGMENT_SHADER);
gl.shaderSource (vs, vs_str);
gl.shaderSource (fs, fs_str);
gl.compileShader (vs);
if (!gl.getShaderParameter (vs, gl.COMPILE_STATUS)) {
  console.error ("ERROR compiling vert shader. log: " +
    gl.getShaderInfoLog (vs));
}
gl.compileShader (fs);
if (!gl.getShaderParameter (fs, gl.COMPILE_STATUS)) {
  console.error ("ERROR compiling frag shader. log: " +
    gl.getShaderInfoLog (fs));
}
var sp = gl.createProgram ();
gl.attachShader (sp, vs);
gl.attachShader (sp, fs);
gl.bindAttribLocation (sp, 0, "vp");
gl.bindAttribLocation (sp, 1, "vt");
gl.bindAttribLocation (sp, 2, "vn");
gl.linkProgram (sp);
if (!gl.getProgramParameter (sp, gl.LINK_STATUS)) {
  console.error ("ERROR linking program. log: " + gl.getProgramInfoLog (sp));
}
gl.validateProgram (sp);
if (!gl.getProgramParameter(sp, gl.VALIDATE_STATUS)) {
  console.error ("ERROR validating program. log: " +
    gl.getProgramInfoLog (sp));
}
var heckler_PV_loc = gl.getUniformLocation (sp, "PV");
var heckler_M_loc = gl.getUniformLocation (sp, "M");</pre>

	<p>
		"PV" is my combined projection and view matrix, and "M" is my model matrix.
		Although similar to OpenGL in C, you can see things like string functions are
		a little bit easier to deal with. If you refresh the browser and look in the
		console you should get an error message (including shader and linker logs) if
		that didn't work. If you want to be sure that the shader code loaded, you can
		use <tt>alert (vs_str);</tt> to throw up an alert box with the vertex shader
		string.
	</p>

	<h2>Loading a Mesh File with AJAX</h2>

	<p>
		I have a mesh file that I want to render - a Wavefront .obj file I made for a
		recent game jam. What I want to do is read the .obj file into a string, then
		use JavaScript string parsing functions (which are quite good) to break that
		up into lists of points, texture coordinates, and normals. We can use AJAX for
		that, which works like this:
	</p>

	<pre>
var xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
xmlhttp.open ("GET", "OUR_URL_STRING_HERE", true);
xmlhttp.onload = function (e) {
  var str = xmlhttp.responseText;
  var lines = str.split ('\n');
  for (var i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
    //...parsing code goes here...
  }
}
xmlhttp.send ();</pre>

	<p>
		First, we get an interface to a new XMLHTTPRequest (AJAX' real name). We tell
		it that it will use the HTTP "GET" request to retrieve a file from a URL, which
		we will give it as a string. Finally, it prefers to work asynchronously, which
		can be quite tricky to set up in JavaScript, but is worth doing to get the best
		loading time. If you prefer to skip this extra fuss you can set the third
		parameter of the <tt>open()</tt> function to <tt>false</tt>, but the browser
		will complain to you in the console.

	<p>
		We can handle our asynchronous download with AJAX in the same way as we handled
		the texture - adding an <tt>is_loaded</tt> attribute. I'll also check that the
		texture was loaded, because it would look terrible if the VAO loaded first,
		and rendered with some other texture:
	</p>

	<pre>
var my_vao = start_loading_obj ("meshes/my_mesh.obj");
...
// _inside the main drawing loop_
if (my_vao.is_loaded && texture.is_loaded) {
  vao_ext.bindVertexArrayOES (my_vao);
  ...
  // draw stuff that requires the VAO
}</pre>

	<p>
		I won't paste the 50-lines or so for .obj parsing here, but you can view it at
		<a href="https://antongerdelan.net/opengl/webgl_starter/obj_parser.js">obj_parser.js</a>.
		There are many ways that you can structure your JavaScript objects and
		functions. Another annoying limitation to JavaScript is that you cannot really
		pass back more than one variable from a function as you can in C. You might
		consider creating a mesh container object that holds a VAO and a point count,
		or simply adding the vertex point count as another attribute in your VAO like
		I do here - it all depends on how much abstraction you like to have in your
		working code.
	</p>

	<pre>
function start_loading_obj (url) {
  // first create an empty VAO
  var vao = vao_ext.createVertexArrayOES ();
  // inject an is_loaded boolean
  vao.is_loaded = false;
  // inject point count into VAO (yeah...)
  vao.pc = 0;

  var xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
  xmlhttp.open ("GET", url, true);
  xmlhttp.onload = function (e) {
    var str = xmlhttp.responseText;
    var lines = str.split ('\n');
    for (var i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {
      //...parsing code goes here...
    }
    // store loaded state and point count in VAO
    vao.pc = sorted_vp.length / 3;
    vao.is_loaded = true;
  }
  // start loading
  xmlhttp.send ();
  // return the empty VAO
  return vao;
}</pre>

	<p>
		Note that, similar to the texture creation, the first step is to <u>create a
			valid, but empty, VAO</u>. This will be returned to the function caller whilst
		the download starts. That means that even if the download has not finished, our
		main programme still has a valid handle to the eventual VAO, and can check its
		state. The <tt>send</tt> function starts the HTTP
		handshaking. When the file has actually downloaded to the client the
		<tt>onload</tt> callback function will start - some-time after the original
		function call returned. It's very easy to make a mistake here when testing. On
		a local network the download won't have a delay. From another continent, with a
		large mesh, the delay could take some time - <b>when testing asynchronous
			download code, check over the longest and worst connection possible</b>. You
		will definitely make mistakes with the little check flags and callbacks, and
		have code that assumes something has downloaded without sufficiently checking.
	</p>

	<p>
		In your parsing code you can use the <tt>str.split ('\n');</tt> command to
		return an array of strings; one for each line in the file, and parse that in a
		loop with <tt>for (var i = 0; i < lines.length; i++) {</tt>. Note that JavaScript uses dynamic arrays
				(basically
				C++ vectors), and they always know their own length. </p>
	<p>
		To include an external JavaScript file, we just add another <tt>script</tt>
		block, and specify the <tt>src="path_to_file.js"</tt> attribute.
	</p>

	<textarea rows="2">
<script src="webgl_starter/obj_parser.js">
</script></textarea>

	<p>
		I have a relative path to my file here. Note that <b>you must have a closing
			script tag</b> - you cannot have a single, self-closing
		<tt>&lt;script /&gt;</tt> tag, as you can with other types of HTML element. This new
		script block should really appear before our other block, so that the browser
		parses it before it is used. If you don't do this it will still work, but the
		browser might warn you that it has been forced to load the script
		less efficiently.
	</p>

	<h3>Cross-Origin File Access</h3>

	<p>
		If you're loading your web page from your desktop AJAX may complain and refuse to
		load files as it violates security policy. You can put your content on a local
		web-server - there are many light-weight servers available. You can start
		Chrome with the <tt>--disable-web-security</tt> command-line flag to ignore
		this precaution, or you can just use Firefox, which should ignore this problem
		entirely and load your files.
	</p>

	<h2>Creating Matrices</h2>

	<p>
		You will need a set of vector and matrix maths functions for JavaScript. A very
		popular library is Brandon Jones'
		<a href="https://github.com/toji/gl-matrix">gl-matrix</a>. I also ported
		<a href="https://github.com/capnramses/apg">my maths library</a> to
		JavaScript. You can of course also write your own. It's easier to just leave
		matrices and vectors in JavaScript's native array format, rather than creating
		custom data structures.
	</p>

	<p>
		It's worth having a look at the source code of a
		JavaScript maths library to see how functions, parameters, and arrays work in
		JavaScript. Functions do not have declarations - just a definition. They are
		all prefixed with the <tt>function</tt> keyword instead of a data-type, and can
		return or not return a value. Parameters are just given name, and do not
		require a <tt>var</tt> prefix. Currying and more advanced functional
		programming is possible. Arrays are given as comma-separated lists of values
		inside square brackets. An empty array is created with either
		<tt>var my_array = []</tt> or <tt>var my_array = new Array ()</tt>.
	</p>

	<p>
		I just include my maths library with another script block. I create my view
		and projection matrices with familiar-looking functions:
	</p>

	<pre>
var cam_dirty = true;
var V = look_at ([0.0, 0.4, 1.0], [0.0, 0.4, 0.0],
  normalise_vec3 ([0.0, 1.0, 0.0]));
var aspect = canvas.clientWidth / canvas.clientHeight;
var P = perspective (67.0, aspect, 0.1, 100.0);
var PV = mult_mat4_mat4 (P, V);</pre>

	<p>
		<b>Very important JavaScript note:</b> my canvas dimensions are integers, but
		division here does floating point division, not integer division. This could be
		your first encounter with the horrible bits of JavaScript. If you want a
		particular data type you usually have to enforce it with particular truncation
		or parsing functions - floating point or string seem to be a kind of default
		assumed data type in JavaScript in most cases.
	</p>

	<h2>Drawing in a Loop</h2>

	<p>
		To have a loop in JavaScript the best strategy is to create function that you
		put the code to be looped inside, and notify the browser that you want to call
		this function again when it finishes. Unfortunately, the actual function to
		request a repeat call does not seem to have been standardised over all the
		browsers. I took a snippet from Google's <tt>webgl-utils.js</tt> file to
		encapsulate that in a cross-browser function:
	</p>

	<pre>
window.requestAnimFrame = (function() {
return window.requestAnimationFrame ||
  window.webkitRequestAnimationFrame ||
  window.mozRequestAnimationFrame ||
  window.oRequestAnimationFrame ||
  window.msRequestAnimationFrame ||
  function(callback, element) {
    return window.setTimeout (callback, 1000 / 60);
  };
})();</pre>

	<p>
		If you put that somewhere in your script blocks we can call it. We will also
		write a function to repeat that will do our drawing. This can go after your
		start-up code if you like:
	</p>

	<pre>
var previous_millis;

function main_loop () {
  // update timers
  var current_millis = performance.now ();
  var elapsed_millis = current_millis - previous_millis;
  previous_millis = current_millis;
  var elapsed_s = elapsed_millis / 1000.0;
  
  // draw
  gl.clear (gl.COLOR_BUFFER_BIT | gl.DEPTH_BUFFER_BIT);
  gl.activeTexture (gl.TEXTURE0);
  gl.bindTexture (gl.TEXTURE_2D, texture);
  gl.useProgram (sp);
  if (cam_dirty) {
    gl.uniformMatrix4fv (heckler_PV_loc, gl.FALSE, new Float32Array (PV));
    cam_dirty = false;
  }
  var R = rotate_y_deg (identity_mat4 (), current_millis * 0.075);
  gl.uniformMatrix4fv (heckler_M_loc, gl.FALSE, new Float32Array (R));
  vao_ext.bindVertexArrayOES (heckler_vao);
  gl.drawArrays (gl.TRIANGLES, 0, heckler_vao.pc);
  
  // "automatically re-call this function please"
  window.requestAnimFrame (main_loop, canvas);
}</pre>

	<p>
		I like to have some timers in my loop so I can do animations, and measure
		frame rate and so on. You can use the browser's <tt>performance.now()</tt>
		function to do this, which gives you milliseconds since the page loaded, with
		your system's maximum precision up to nanoseconds - much more reliable than
		JavaScript's data and time functions. After this I start my drawing code. I
		update my matrix uniform for the projection and view if it hasn't been updated
		yet. There are some peculiarities with the uniform update function for
		matrices. The transposition argument must be set to false in WebGL - it won't
		do a transposition for you. It's a good idea to force the matrix' array to take
		a 32-bit float data type, and you can do that by creating a new
		<tt>Float32Array</tt> object. Right at the end of the function I call the
		request-to-call-again function. Buffer swapping and the
		actual drawing of the final image to the canvas are handled automatically.
		Right at the end of the script block we can actually call this
		function, which will start the looping process:
	</p>


	<pre>
previous_millis = performance.now();
main_loop ();</pre>

	<p>
		Those are the basics of WebGL, which should be enough to get started if you've
		done a bit of OpenGL before.
	</p>

	<h2>Advancing</h2>

	<p>
		The browser has a plethora of functions and features that you can access. You
		can look at user interaction with the mouse, keyboard, touch-screens for mobile
		devices, and even the new W3C gamepad/joystick interface. You can look at
		setting up more sophisticated asynchronous file streaming.
	</p>

	<p>
		Having a set of GUI tools from HTML can not be understated. You can use all of
		the web's additions to charts, sliders, buttons, and most importantly you have
		text rendering. You can overlay these on top of the canvas if you like <i>via</i> CSS.
		You can also float the canvas over other web content, and make the background
		transparent.
	</p>

	<p>
		Browsers have built-in debugging, source, stepping, and watch-list tools. You
		can do some very comprehensive debugging inside the browser, and even enter
		new JavaScript code in as the application is running. It's a good idea to try
		out these tools.
	</p>

	<p>
		Be sure to watch the development of the new WebGL 2.0 standard, and see if your
		browsers already have an early version of this running.
	</p>

			Beginner's Guide</i>, from PACKT.
