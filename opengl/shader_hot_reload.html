	<p>
		Being able to edit your shader code and see what visually changes, live, without restarting your program, is really
		handy. It's also a lot more fun, and you'll get nicer-looking shaders out as a result! If you've ever played around
		at <a href="https://www.shadertoy.com/">Shadertoy</a> you'll know what I mean.
		This kind of idea is often referred to as <i>hot-reloading</i>.
		It's not too hard to set this up for your OpenGL programs.
	</p>

	<p>
		You do not need it to follow this tutorial, but for reference
		my finished example code is available in <a
			href="https://github.com/capnramses/antons_opengl_tutorials_book/tree/master/41_shader_hot_reload">the GitHub
			repository for my OpenGL tutorials book</a>.
	</p>

	<h2>Starting Point</h2>

	<p>
		Let's start with a minimal, functioning program that displays something with a shader. We can take a working <a
			href="hellotriangle.html">Hello Triangle</a> as a starting point. The next step is to move shader creation into
		separate functions.
		Let's create the following functions:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Create a shader program from 2 provided strings; a vertex shader, and a fragment shader.</li>
		<li>Create a shader program from 2 provided file names; one for each shader.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>Create Shader Program From Strings</h3>

	<p>
		If you're working from a <i>Hello Triangle</i> that loads shaders from hard-coded strings it should be
		fairly straight-forward to move the code that links and compiles shaders into a function, and call that.
		I'm going to return the handle to a valid shader program on success, or 0 on any error.
	</p>

	<pre>
GLuint create_shader_program_from_strings(
  const char* vertex_shader_str,
  const char* fragment_shader_str );</pre>

	<p>
		If you don't have it already, it's important that your function checks for shader compile and linking errors here,
		as described in my <a href="shaders.html">Shaders</a> tutorial. My version, with error handling, is reproduced as
		<a href="#listing1">Listing 1</a> at the end of this article. Call your function from your code, and ensure that
		your program still works, before continuing.
	</p>

	<h3>Create Shader Program From Files</h3>

	<p>
		We also need a function to load a shader program from files. This function can copy shader file contents into
		strings and call the previous function.
	</p>

	<pre>
GLuint create_shader_program_from_files(
  const char* vertex_shader_filename,
  const char* fragment_shader_filename );</pre>

	<p>
		If we move our vertex shader string into a new file called
		<tt>myshader.vert</tt>,
		and the fragment shader into <tt>myshader.frag</tt> we can modify our program so that it creates our shader program
		from
		a function that takes those two file names.
	</p>

	<pre>
GLuint create_shader_program_from_files(
  const char* vertex_shader_filename,
  const char* fragment_shader_filename ) {
  
  // load files into strings here

  return create_shader_program_from_strings( vertex_shader_str, fragment_shader_str );
}</pre>

	<p>
		My function to do this is reproduced in <a href="#listing2">Listing
			2</a>. There is no need for your function to be as verbose as mine - I added extra validation detail for
		consideration. You should get your function working before continuing. This is a bit trickier than the previous
		function. Some potential issues and their solutions are described in the <a href="#problems">Common Problems</a>
		sections.
	</p>

	<h2>Function to Reload a Shader From Source Files</h2>

	<p>
		The next stage of the plan is to reload our shader when we hit a keyboard button - I'll use 'R'. The actual
		reloading you could do in several ways. In one of my projects, I load, compile, and link the shaders again, and if
		anything failed I replace the shader with a simple fall-back that renders everything in a solid colour. This gives
		me visual indication that I've made a mistake in my shader. Shadertoy and similar prefer to report compile errors in
		text, but leave the displayed shader unmodified if something didn't work. It's up to you. Let's go for the second
		approach. To do this we need a new function:
	</p>

	<pre>
void reload_shader_program_from_files(
  GLuint* program,
  const char* vertex_shader_filename,
  const char* fragment_shader_filename );</pre>

	<p>
		The algorithm that the function will implement can be described like this:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Create a new shader program from the given file names. Halt on failure - return from the function. </li>
		<li>Delete our previous shader program.</li>
		<li>Change the value of our shader program handle to the value of the new program.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		Because we want our original shader program to remain untouched in case of failure, we don't modify it, but create a
		new program. On success simply delete it and continue as per normal, using the new handle. For larger shaders this
		may introduce a stutter in your program. The file reading in your functions could be done in a thread,
		but I would not consider this until you actually need it.
	</p>

	<pre>
void reload_shader_program_from_files(
  GLuint* program,
  const char* vertex_shader_filename,
  const char* fragment_shader_filename ) {

  assert( program && vertex_shader_filename && fragment_shader_filename );

  GLuint reloaded_program = create_shader_program_from_files(
    vertex_shader_filename, fragment_shader_filename );

  if ( reloaded_program ) {
    glDeleteProgram( *program );
    *program = reloaded_program;
  }
}</pre>

	<p>
		You can call this function within your main loop:
	</p>

	<pre>
if ( glfwGetKey( window, GLFW_KEY_R ) ) {
  reload_shader_program_from_files( &shader_program, "myshader.vert", "myshader.frag" );
}</pre>

	<p>
		Now try changing the output colour in your fragment shader file, and hit 'R' with your program's window focused.
		When you have this working you are already in a significantly better place to edit shaders on the fly! You can
		see that it would be a much nicer workflow to add lighting and shading to. Any shader errors should print to the
		console. You could stop here - this is usually enough for most of my projects.
	</p>

	<h2>Polling the File System for Changes</h2>

	<p>
		If you would rather have your shaders automatically reload on change, without needing to hit a button, you can
		periodically ask
		the file system. The system headers and functions that you need to use vary based on operating system. For
		multi-platform
		support you will need to make a small utility with <tt>ifdef</tt> clauses per-platform.
	</p>

	<p>
		I may add some code to do this in the future to the source code example, but will not add it here for brevity. The
		basic concept is to
		ask the system to watch your shader files, or directory containing shader files, ask it if anything has changed
		every
		now and again, and then
		call your reload function on shader programs that have had one or both of their source files modified.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>On Windows you can use <a
				href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-findfirstchangenotificationa">the
				file API</a>.</li>
		<li>On OS X you can use <b>FSEvents</b>.</li>
		<li>On Linux you can use <b>inotify</b>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		If you know of any reference examples doing the above with shaders, I am happy to link them at the end of this
		article.
	</p>

	<p>
		You may also use libraries such as Qt or Boost, but beware these will add very significant complexity to your
		project, which you can avoid by writing your own small utility.
	</p>

	<p>
		At this point you've probably considered that you will have several shader programs, and it would make sense to
		remember which programs have which filenames. You can create a simple data structure to do so, and/or put them in an
		array of all of your loaded shader programs:
	</p>

	<pre>
struct shader_program_t {
  GLuint program_handle;
  char vertex_shader_filename[1024];
  char fragment_shader_filename[1024];
};</pre>

	<h2>Suggestions</h2>

	<p>
		Add some additional inputs to your shaders - uniforms such as the time (you can use the value returned by
		<tt>glfwGetTime()</tt>),
		additional vertex shader inputs such as texture
		coordinates, a noise texture, etc.
		Then you have plenty of ingredients to play with for interesting animated effects. Combining the current time as a
		float,
		with the position of a fragment on a surface,
		with a <tt>sin()</tt> or cosine wave, gives you a huge amount of potential to live-edit to create interesting
		effects, or
		modify other shader effects. Shadertoy even combines shaders with audio waveforms. There are plenty of ideas in
		Shadertoy demos.
	</p>

	<h2>Can I Reload Meshes and Textures Too?</h2>

	<p>
		You might have been wondering if the same process can be used to improve your workflow with other asset files.
		The answer is yes! I do this in my projects to reload textures and meshes, so I can modify them and see how they
		interact with the rest of the scene - how they are affected by scale, lighting, and shaders. Remember that our
		perception of colour is affected by the surrounding colours, so you can get a different impression of your images
		edited with a white editor background, to how they look in the final scene.
	</p>

	<h2 id="problems">Common Problems</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>
			Linking and compiling - you should be able to re-use the libraries and build settings from a working OpenGL
			Hello Triangle project. It requires only OpenGL, GLEW, and GLFW. I wrote my program for this article on a
			Windows machine and compiled it with MinGW-w64.
			The compilation instruction I used is at the top of the file's source code. There is also a Makefile.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>"[MS Visual Studio] program can't find my shader files!"</i> - As with other data files, Visual Studio projects
			may set a different <b>current working directory</b> than what you might expect, when running the program from
			within the editor. Look in your project settings for your working directory path. It's usually set to in some
			directory relative to the solution file, and you can change this setting.
		</li>
		<li>
			<i>"It worked on my computer!" - File reading and operating system issues.</i> Be careful with any file reading
			operations that copy the entire file into a dynamically allocated buffer. If you are not reading the file in
			binary mode, then different characters are appended to the ends of lines and buffers on different operating
			systems,
			which may mean your program's buffer needs to be larger than the file it is reading from. I used large fixed-size
			arrays, so I didn't need to worry about that. Read the manual pages of the functions that you are using for more
			details.
		</li>
	</ul>
