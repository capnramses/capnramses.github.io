	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>Interpolation Functions aka "Tweening" or "Easing"</h2>

	<p>
		In visualisation and games we often have animated transitions of visual
		elements. This could be an actor walking between two points, or a menu button
		moving into place, or a perhaps chart transitioning to a new data set. Most of
		the transition animations are fluff - they provide no intrinsic value
		whatsoever, but appear pleasing to the user/audience. And there is value in
		that, lots of value. Arguably these transitions are more important to
		animations which only store "key frames" and expect real-time animation to
		interpolate between these as required. On St Patrick's Day holiday I spent
		some time looking into this and making my own interpolation library.
	</p>

	<p>
		There is a lot of dubious-quality literature around on this topic, which very
		much reads like a bad re-invention of really basic mathematical functions. A
		quick google on "easing functions" or "tweening" [cringe] will give you a slice
		of this. There are some nice, animated, examples at
		<a href="http://easings.net/">easings.net</a>. I wanted to use some similar
		functions in my own projects to add some glitter value, but I immediately found
		some problems with the available resources:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>A non-standard notation convention for variables is used, which I find
			confusing.</li>
		<li>Basic mathematical functions like exponentials tend to be crudely
			approximated with staggered if-else statements, as if the writer didn't know
			how to make a simple quadratic or exponential function.</li>
		<li>Code in commonly-used libraries would generate in-efficient machine code,
			is hard to read, and is of a generally poor standard.</li>
		<li>Functions all proceed in one direction, but are named "in" and "out"
			instead of an accurate analogy such as "accelerating" and "decelerating".</li>
		<li>Functions are "impure" in that they have fixed-sized lead-ins to wave
			functions tied to the same scale - this seems flat out dumb. Why not use two
			separate functions for the lead-in and wobble?</li>
		<li>Most of the non-linear transition functions in the "easing" functions are
			so similar when viewed in one dimension that you couldn't tell the difference
			without looking at a 2d chart.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		With these considerations I decided to just make my own little collection of
		interpolation functions. I immediately threw out most of the package of
		"easing" functions, and only implemented the few that I thought would provide
		obvious and interesting transitions. Rather than copy the common functions from
		some library, I just approximated them with as simple as possible pure maths
		functions, and as little logic as possible. I replaced all the unusual input
		parameters with current x, initial x, final x, initial y, and final y, the way
		we would define these things in my mechanics education.

	<p>
		I started with the above, simple functions, which are pretty similar to the
		"easing" set, and modelled them in gnuplot to see if they looked okay. Then
		I smashed them into some simple C functions with my basic parameters. The
		code is available
		<a href="https://github.com/capnramses/apg_interp/blob/master/apg_interp.h">on GitHub</a>.
		I tried it out for a title animation in my Crongdor the Barbarian game, and it
		looked pretty good. I wanted the title to drop down, and then bounce, as if
		hitting a surface. Rather than use a fixed-size lead-in, as in the easing
		functions, I just did an exponential interpolation (like gravity) between start
		height, and end height, then a bounce interpolation, which for me is like a
		linearly diminishing absolute sine wave.
