	<h2>The Trouble with C, and Using C99</h2>

	<p>
		About three years ago I finally realised that all my C++ programmes were
		grossly over-complicated and enormously time-inefficient to write. Part of this
		was due to getting carried away with design patterns, refactoring, abstraction
		layers, and other software engineering busywork that I now believe basically
		exists as a trap to capture OCD-inclined people and hold them in project
		purgatory indefinitely. The other part was due to C++ itself. I think that I
		can summarise my perception thus:

	<h3>The Choices</h3>

	<p>
		So what I really want now is to produce things <b>quickly</b>. Now <b>I
			appreciate low-level simplicity more than abstraction</b>. Fewer, well-chosen
		features makes a stronger language than a huge variety of features of varying
		quality and usefulness. How can I get the advantages of
		C++ without the disadvantages? In the last 3 years I have been experimenting
		with several styles of C++ and C.
	</p>

	<h4>Pedantic C89</h4>

	<p>
		C89, the "default" C on most compilers has a pleasing simplicity but can be
		rather frustrating when it comes to variable declarations. In 3d graphics,
		having overloaded operators for vector and matrix data-types is rather handy,
		and writing functions to do this can be a pain.
		In pedantic compile mode the compiler will whine if you
		use single-line comments. You could just leave out the pedantic flag, but would
		you miss something interesting?
		C89 is an acceptable solution
		and writes very portable, concise code, but we are stuck with some tedious
		relics of the past.
	</p>

	<h4>"C++--"</h4>

	<p>
		The obvious solution to get most of the best of all worlds is my original style
		of C compiled with the C++ compiler. We can link-in libraries from C++ which
		is very handy. We do assume some passive C++ problems though - mangled function
		headers - so we have to be prepared to use open-source everything or sacrifice
		portability.
	</p>

	<h4>C99</h4>

	<p>
		Most C compilers can be coerced into compiling for the C99 standard with a flag
		like <tt>-std=c99 -pedantic-errors</tt>. The Internet says this isn't the
		default because the implementations are still not completed! You can read about
		the status of C99 implementation in the GCC project at
		<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/c99status.html">https://gcc.gnu.org/c99status.html</a>.
		It seems that there are only one or two minor optional features that have been
		left out there.
	</p>

	<p>
		C99 offers a collection of features that you probably won't want if you like
		being in control of low-level code - variable-length arrays, and some extra
		stuff that's interesting but probably not used that often - complex numbers,
		but it does have single-line comments, mixed declarations and code, better
		type casting rules, inline functions, boolean data type <i>via</i>
		<tt>stdbool.h</tt> and variations of the standard types of integers and floats
		for specific memory sizes. You can use the <tt>pragma</tt> pre-processor
		directive.
	</p>

	<h4>C11</h4>

	<p>
		C11 introduces native multi-threading and better Unicode support <i>via</i>
		<tt>char16_t</tt> and <tt>char32_t</tt>, some bounds-checking stuff and file
		pointers that can open and exclusive-access lock a file. The status of C11 in
		GCC is <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/C11Status">https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/C11Status</a>.
		You can ask for C11 in GCC ~4.7 and newer with <tt>-std=c11</tt>. Some of the
		new features have dubious support in <tt>glibc</tt> which makes the standard
		not so attractive for just a few additional low-value features.
	</p>

	<h3>Summary</h3>

	<p>
		I have had the best experiences of all my programming so far with C99. Some
		limitations I can name are:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>poor/inconsistent/conflicted Unicode or wide-character support</li>
		<li>cumbersome generic parsing functions compared to other languages
			(<tt>strtok()</tt> still really really sucks)</li>
		<li>poor native memory diagnostics</li>
		<li>poor native time library</li>
		<li>lose compatibility with C++ libraries</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>
		Don't take everything as law from your software engineering teachers. If it
		smells like BS it probably is.
