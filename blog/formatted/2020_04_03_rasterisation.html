	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>Software Rasterisation Resources</h2>

	<p>I talked about building a software 3D rasteriser in some of my recent live streams, and people asked if I could
		share my resources.
		If you start with a program that can write out an image then you can progressively add features one by one, which is
		quite fun.
		If you find a <b>triangle fill</b> algorithm to rasterise one triangle (colour the correct pixels between 3 corner
		points) then you're on the right path.
		It's easier, and arguably more fun, to write a simple software rasteriser than get a modern 3D API started, which is
		kind of silly. Yes, it is a good way to learn 3D graphics concepts, much like writing a software ray tracer. Here is
		some of my demo code.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/triangle_fill.png" alg="A single rasterised triangle" />
	</div>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/capnramses/gfx_expmts/tree/master/075_triangle_fill">Code</a> for a single triangle
			fill using an edge function.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/capnramses/gfx_expmts/tree/master/076_sw_rasteriser">Code</a> for the software
			rasteriser I wrote in December as a demo for my students.</li>
	</ul>

	</div>

	<p>
		In my <a href="https://github.com/capnramses/gfx_expmts">graphics experiments repository</a> you'll also find code
		for animating graphics in an X11 window, and a starter for rasterising a cube in an X11 window.
		I have a similar demo somewhere that rasterises a 3D spinning cube into a 2D canvas element on a webpage.
	</p>

	<p>I may have some lecture slides from last year about this process that could be helpful - I'll have to dig further
		to find them...</p>
