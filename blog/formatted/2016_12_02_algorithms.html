	<h2>Teaching Algorithms</h2>

	<p>
		I've been extremely busy teaching and making on-the-fly a new Algorithms course at Trinity College Dublin for the
		3rd-year engineering students. It's just about finished, and went
		pretty well. I'll post more information when I get a bit of time after end-of-year. The above animation is from a
		demonstration program that I wrote for the class of the A* Algorithm - a computationally efficient modification of
		Dijkstra's Algorithm for finding the shortest route between two nodes in a graph.
