	<h3>3D Picking, Debug Geometry, Engines</h3>
	<p>
		I coded an algorithm for 3D mouse picking of objects based on their bounding sphere. I have a C version and
		a Javascript version. Experience tells me that I need to visualise as much of the algorithm as possible to make
		sure that all the ducks are in a row. I think that I can draw some debug geometry to show the bounding spheres;
		actually draw transluscent spheres around each pick-able object. I could change their colour when they are being
		clicked on. That would give me an indication if the algorithm is working accurately, but also if the spheres are
		a good enough approximation for bounds, based on how much the spheres overlap.
	</p>
	<p>
		My Javascript WebGL demos are a bit messy, so I've started to build a little engine. I think something like a
		<tt>Renderable.createSphere()</tt> sort of function is in order. My OpenGL C code is pretty stable, so I think
		I can just create a <tt>createSphere</tt> sort of function directly.
	</p>
	<h3>Timers</h3>
	<p>
		I had a look at the timer javascript that I've been using. I suspect that I can tweak it a bit to improve the
		rendering rate.
