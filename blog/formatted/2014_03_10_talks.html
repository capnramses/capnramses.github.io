	<h2>Some Recent Talks</h2>

	<h3>Shaders - Teaching Modern Computer Graphics</h3>

	<p>
		Last week I was invited to do a talk at the University of Hull. I wanted to
		share some experiences with teaching the modern graphics pipeline with OpenGL
		especially. It turns out that Hull has a lot of experience with this already,
		and a game development course of note. It was great to meet some like-minded
		people, and good to hear that they have had similar experiences and problems.
	</p>

	<p>
		My slides from the talk: <a href="slides/shaders.pdf">shaders.pdf</a>. I didn't
		do HTML slides this time, but had a go with LaTeX Beamer. Much of a muchness
		really, except that you can't browse them as easily. I actually don't usually
		do bullet-point slides, but rather throw up some pictures and talk. The last
		slide points out my biggest gripe - and that's that getting a decent collection
		of reference texts as a student means buying about 3 extremely large and
		expensive volumes, and still not quite getting a practical instruction manual
		or lab exercise book.

	<h3>A Critical Review of IFC Files</h3>

	<p>
		I did a talk at a workshop held here at Trinity College on building information
		modelling. The meetings can be a bit dry so I thought I'd be a bit controversial
		(as is my custom), and criticise the most popular 3d file format for these
		projects - IFC "Industry Foundation Classes". The short story is that it's
		based on a file format called STEP, which is awefully inefficient (as I've
		talked about in previous posts). I am suggesting instead that projects look at
		the up-and-coming <a href="http://www.khronos.org/gltf">glTF</a> format, which
		has all of the flexibility required, as well as being super-efficient with a
		binary format, and easy to use with a JSON interface. Slides <a href="slides/ifc_anton.pdf">ifc_anton.pdf</a>.
