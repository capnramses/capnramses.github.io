	<h2>Converting Industry Foundation Classes for 3d Graphics</h2>

	<p>
		European public buildings have adopted IFC files as a new standard for
		architectural plans. They're basically an indexed format that has tags for
		lots of
		different types of structural, electrical, etc. plans within a single file. I
		wrote a couple of parsers to read structural data from the format directly,
		but it's really not efficient to do this as part of specialised viewing
		programme [read: grossly inefficient and not at all practical], especially if
		you want a light-weight browser-driven web script to do it. There are
		specialised libraries for doing this, but once again I find that it's really
		bloated when all you want to do is display some geometry. This is an order of
		magnitude more 'heavy' than the similar "do everything for all purposes" XML
		COLLADA graphics format.
	</p>

	<h3>Why IFC is Not Appropritate for Modern Visualisation Hardware</h3>

	<p>
		Modern graphics processors only draw triangles. IFC meshes are not arranged in
		triangles. Nor are they lists of quads. What you get is a jumble of different
		'template' pieces like 'WallA', and 'WallSectionB2' that are reused here and
		there like LEGO prefab bricks. You can get vertex points out of each prefab,
		which means that you can construct your triangulated mesh eventually. Each
		prefab can call on other prefabs. That's okay, but <b>each prefab has it's own
			coordinate space</b>. This creates a small nightmare for parsing, as you have
		to 1. do a lot of store-fetch-lookup-store-fetch type of operations to
		construct the final mesh, and 2. as you do it recurse a matrix hierarchy to
		assemble the mesh into a single coordinate space. Now, assuming that you've
		triangulated it all you have a reconstructed mesh you can draw. This can take
		up to a minute on a modern CPU, for a moderately complex building model [and
		generate a lot of unnecessary carbon] which is really not acceptible if you're
		making a user-friendly interface.
	</p>

	<p>
		I suspect that the original file format design did consider 3d rendering, but
		not modern 3d rendering. It would have lent itself to OpenGL 1.1/2.1 rendering,
		which had fixed-function blocks that could render quads. That might have been
		okay for rendering all the different prefab bits separately with
		<tt>begin()</tt> and <tt>end()</tt> commands, with the vertices pumped in
		one-by-one, and told to draw as quads. Neither of these concepts are
		available now; and in fact, it is impractically slow to draw a whole building
		like this in real-time (it has been tried). We need to pack the whole mesh into
		a single array of triangles, and draw the whole thing in parallel on the GPU.
		Hence why all of the parsing and assembly is a problem. Putting it all together
		means that we've lost a lot of the ability to individually highlight or tinker
		with the separate pieces in a flexible way. I have some ideas for how to do
		this, but it must really be tailored to the individual end-use scenario
		- unfortunately it's just not efficient to do this in a fully-flexible way.
		Modern GPU design just isn't good at that sort of thing.
	</p>

	<h3>Work-Arounds</h3>

	<p>
		My initial software didn't use the IFC files. It turns out that these are
		usually not the primary format being worked on my architects, but rather they'll
		use a typical CAD design programme, and convert into IFC later. What we did was
		grab the original CAD files and export an XML file, then parse that.
		Considerably faster, but still not ideal. On a range of devices you really want
		something that can be interpreted without XML; a JSON format for WebGL, and a
		plain-text C-ready format for everything else, so a better solution would be to
		convert to a specialised graphics format. Most CAD software should be able to
		generate a Wavefront .obj static mesh, which is fairly trivial to parse, but
		an ideal solution would treat the IFC file as the source, because it's becoming
		a standard sort of thing, and convert that to a custom graphics format. A
		pre-processing stage is okay, and then you don't need to keep a second file
		with the IFC file just for graphics - it can be generated as needed.
	</p>

	<h3>Converter Attempt 1</h3>

	<p>
		A couple of posts ago I made a general purpose converter that took just about
		any format, and output to my new custom format. It turns out that this should
		be able to do the painful job of constructing a mesh from IFC as well, and
		stripping out all the non-graphics bits. I gave it a go with one of Karlsruhe
		IT's sample IFC meshes:
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/ifccustom.png"><br />
		<small><i>Converting a sample IFC mesh into a custom format sort-of worked.
			</i></small>
	</div>

	<p>
		The output mesh is massively simplified into a long array of points forming
		what should be triangles. The holes and incorrect link-ups in the viewer look
		like some of the mesh might have been exported in quads of 4 points (hence the
		holes because it was expecting triangles), and some in triangles (the cars are
		all correct). I guess the triangulation wasn't consistent. Perhaps I can load
		it into Blender first to check that out.
	</p>

	<p>
		The nice thing about having a custom
		converter is that you have the option of adding your own annotations to
		different parts of the mesh, for example:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>sub-divide the mesh into different sub-meshes for more efficient rendering</li>
		<li>interactively colourise different rooms/floors/things of interest in specific colours</li>
		<li>animate moving parts of the mesh to display different states</li>
		<li>create a colourised version for use in a second framebuffer - this could
			for example, be used to detect if a user has clicked on different parts of interest
			(there's no way to sensibly do this with a single mesh)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		An observation about 3d architectural plans is that they aren't very efficient,
		as a rule - the architects will add more polygons to minutely detail things
		like stair rails, or bayonette lamp fittings, that basically aren't at all
		important in the context of the whole scene. You can see in the image above
		that some completely flat areas have been sub-divided into large numbers of
		polygons for no reason at all. This means that we have been doing a lot of
		manual clean-up-and-tidy work on architectural plans before we visualise them.
		Some of this could potentially be automated, but any automation will inevitably
		introduce some error. Identifying highly-detailed components and separating
		them from the main mesh might be an idea worth considering. Then the user
		could tick check-boxes to display these things i.e. be lazy and let the user
		decide if it's important to display stair rails or not. I suspect that a better
		idea would be some sort of indication to the actual designers at the CAD level,
		or a "can I flatten this area into a single quad?" prompt-based optimisation
		script that can be run before exporting.

		I'm investigating this topic as part of a wider range of visualisation topics
