	<h3>Madness</h3>

	<p>
		I wrote a set of shaders that displayed the camera data in 3d by converting the angles that I'd processed from
		the data into 3d positions (just along the x axis at the moment). It looked a bit boring as dots, so blew it up a
		bit and drew a face on it. I tried to add a "history" idea by having several copies of the vertex buffer that
		show the previous few states as a fading-to-transparency trail behind the current frame's data. I'm displaying it
		in real-time but that's not actually necessary - it could be stepped through incrementally. Then something strange
		happened...I'm very tired today and I accidentally uncommented the wrong line - and the experiment from a couple
		of days ago appeared in the background, but the state machine had changed the texture over to the little face...
		quite an unusual composition...I thought I'd have a play and uploaded some rather large mp3 and ogg audio files
		to test out HTML5's audio tags. It's surprisingly good - much faster than streaming youtube, and much much faster
		than downloading the whole file. It works well for big music tracks, but I'm not sure how useful it will be for
		shorter on-demand sound samples i.e. generated speech clips.

	<h3>Next</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			I'll plot the 2nd person from the video as a face - maybe in a different colour or style.
		</li>
		<li>
			I also need to convert the distance estimate into 3D - but only if the 3d scene will be viewed from above.
			If viewed from the same perspective as the real camera then I can recreate the faces excatly, using the pixel
			coords
			and pixel area. hmmmmmm...then I can keep using the 2D ../images/icons.
		</li>
		<li>
			More visualisation tools - I'll need to chat with people and see what other speech/communication research is doing
			with realt-time visualisation.
		</li>
		<li>
			Write more of this WebGL stuff into teaching material.
		</li>
		<li>
			Start to infer some higher-level info: predict the positions so that the characters aren't mixed up, head nodding,
			head
			shaking, etc.
		</li>
	</ul>
