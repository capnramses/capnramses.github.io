	<h2>Comparing glBufferSubData to glMapBufferRange</h2>

	<p>
		Yesterday I had a look at my demo code for OpenGL uniform buffer objects (UBO).
		UBOs are pretty neat - they let you share blocks of uniform variable data
		between multiple shaders. The other feature is that they behave like a GL buffer
		object - the same way as a vertex buffer object (VBO). In my demo I was using
		the older interface to put data into the buffer; <tt>glBufferData</tt> and
		<tt>glBufferSubData</tt>. The newer way to do this, which is recommended by
		the <i>aficionados</i>, is to use <tt>glMapBuffer</tt> and <tt>glMapBufferRange</tt>,
		respectively.
	</p>

	<p>
		In my opinion, OpenGL's major shortcoming isn't some technical or
		programmatic thing, but its documentation, or rather, its style of
		documentation. You can read <u>how</u> to use OpenGL functions in the online
		pages;
		<a href="http://www.opengl.org/sdk/docs/man/docbook4/xhtml/glMapBufferRange.xml">glMapBufferRange</a>,
		but there's no indication as to <u>why</u>, or <u>when</u> to use the functions.
		You can sort-of get hints to this in the extension documentation, but really,
		no - we have to just try them all. My question here is <i>"What are the
			technical and non-technical pros and cons of each alternative?"</i>.
	</p>

	<h3>Some Set Up</h3>

	<p>
		First, we create an empty buffer for the UBO. I'm going to store 2 4X4 camera
		matrices in here. Now, I see the intention with UBOs and <tt>std140</tt> is to
		set up an equivalent C <tt>struct</tt> that matches the block in the shaders,
		but honestly I find that style a bit gross (I'm not an OO person), so I'm just
		going to use simple pointers. I also suspect that it can easily come unstuck and
		become an incorrect analogy if you're not using length-4 vectors.
	</p>

	<textarea rows=4>
GLuint cam_block_buffer;
glGenBuffers (1, &cam_block_buffer);
glBindBuffer (GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER, cam_block_buffer);
glBufferData (GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER, sizeof (float) * 32, NULL, GL_DYNAMIC_DRAW);</textarea>

	<p>
		I'm going to use this UBO in 2 shader programmes, so I'll give it an unique id,
		and bind it to the shaders properly here.
	</p>

	<textarea rows=7>
int block_id = 0;
GLuint uniform_block_index_monkey =
  glGetUniformBlockIndex (monkey_sp, "cam_block");
glUniformBlockBinding (monkey_sp, uniform_block_index_monkey, block_id);
GLuint uniform_block_index_cube_sp =
  glGetUniformBlockIndex (cube_sp, "cam_block");
glUniformBlockBinding (cube_sp, uniform_block_index_cube_sp, block_id);</textarea>

	<p>
		Right, enough about style. Onwards!
	</p>

	<h3>The Auld Way</h3>

	<p>
		Updating buffer data with <tt>glBufferSubData</tt> works like this. Assuming
		that I just want to update my second matrix in the UBO:
	</p>

	<textarea rows=3>
glBindBufferBase (GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER, block_id, cam_block_buffer);
glBufferSubData (
  GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER, sizeof (float) * 16, sizeof (float) * 16, view_mat.m);</textarea>

	<p>
		It's simple C-like pointer offsets, in the style of <tt>memcpy()</tt>. Easy to
		screw-up when you're learning, but easy to fix once you've done that a few
		times, and know what to look for.
	</p>

	<h3>The Map Way</h3>

	<p>
		So, converting the documentation into human language, what the map function does
		is return a pointer to a new block of memory representing your UBO. You can tell
		it to offset this pointer, so that we can have it point to the where the second
		matrix starts. You then <u>modify that memory directly</u>, and call
		<tt>glUnmapBuffer</tt> when you're done, and it should stream your changes into
		the buffer memory on the graphics device. Really, this is the same type of
		function as <tt>BufferSubData</tt> but with a slightly different way of
		accessing the data.
	</p>

	<p>
		I'm going to use <tt>memcpy</tt> here so that it's obvious what I'm doing with
		the memory pointed to. I actually have some overloaded functions to do that
		more concisely but it might be confusing to read.
	</p>

	<textarea rows=10>
glBindBufferBase (GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER, block_id, cam_block_buffer);
float* cam_ubo_ptr = (float*)glMapBufferRange (
  GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER,
  0,
  sizeof (float) * 32,
  GL_MAP_WRITE_BIT | GL_MAP_INVALIDATE_BUFFER_BIT
);
memcpy (&cam_ubo_ptr[0], proj_mat.m, sizeof (float) * 16);
memcpy (&cam_ubo_ptr[16], view_mat.m, sizeof (float) * 16);
glUnmapBuffer(GL_UNIFORM_BUFFER);</textarea>

	<p>
		Okay, binding the block buffer is the same, and then we get this pointer to
		memory. The format and offset parameters are pretty much the same. Just a note
		about that - offsetting to isolate the second matrix didn't work. I'm not sure
		what the point is here then with these offsets.
	</p>

	<p>
		The
		parameters at the end are of interest. We can actually set the map up to read
		rather than write memory. In this case we want to write, so <tt>GL_MAP_WRITE_BIT</tt>.
		The next flag seems to be required, but it doesn't seem to do anything in
		effect. The docs say that it wipes <u>all</u> the data in the buffer but this
		doesn't seem to be the case at all. If I only modify part of the buffer it still
		retains the rest. If I take out this flag entirely it still works the same way.
		Not clear.
	</p>

	<p>
		Finally, you need to call <tt>glUnmapBuffer</tt> or everything will explode.
	</p>

	<h3>Comparison</h3>

	<p>
		In my environment mapping demo there was no noticeable performance difference. I
		suspect that this might be different in much larger projects - perhaps the map
		will scale better with more data. I didn't do any proper CPU/GPU timer queries.
	</p>

	<p>
		In terms of amount of code, the map way is slightly more verbose here, but I've
		deliberately not used any short-cuts for clarity - not a big difference then.
	</p>

	<p>
		One thing I did notice - there are more possibilities for making a mistake
		with the map interface, and really only one way to screw up the buffer sub-data
		function (wrong memory offsets). The documentation for the map is also much more
		convoluted - I'm not entirely sure which flags I need, and I can't really tell
		what <tt>GL_MAP_INVALIDATE_BUFFER_BIT</tt> actually does in reality - perhaps
		it's intended more as a hint to the GL to make more efficient use of memory. I
		see that there are also explicit <tt>glInvalidateBufferSubData()</tt> functions
		to point out parts of buffers that are no longer required, so this follows.
	</p>

	<p>
		It's hard to say when one is better then, from this little test. The map
		functions are core in 3.0, so perhaps that is the most important point of
		difference.
	</p>

	<h3>Also To Try</h3>

	<p>
		OpenGL 4.4 has <tt>glBufferStorage</tt>, which is a newer alternative again to
		<tt>glBufferData</tt>. That might be the next comparison to make! This whole set
		of new functions seems to be from a new type of thinking about efficiency.
