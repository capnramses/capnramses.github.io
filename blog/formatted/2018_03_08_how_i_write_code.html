	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>Minimalism, or "How I Structure Code Quickly in C Without Getting Log-Jammed"</h2>

	<p>
		Because I was asked, here is an overview of how I code quickly in C without getting log-jammed in
		structural mess. A lot of this should work for other languages too. Key concepts - keep it quick
		to get stuff on screen, keep it fun, let structure emerge on it's own, write code that's low cost to
		throw out if it doesn't work out, don't make refactoring work for yourself. Basically don't follow
		any of the rulesâ„¢!
	</p>

	<h3>Starting Off</h3>

	<p>
		I really like starting a new project with a blank page. Zen. Just think about the problem or what
		you want to make.
	</p>

	<p>
		I break jobs down into agile-like tasks of roughly <b>2 hour</b> duration - works well for me to
		balance work vs. reward and keep things manageable. I have a glorified TODO list -
		<a href="https://trello.com/b/4Yx0L0wO/project-storm">I like Trello</a>.
		It's a TODO list with pictures. You can make a check-list to further break down a task.
		Pick something do-able and non-scary to start off. This is usually comprised of one or two functions.
	</p>

	<h3>Writing Functions</h3>

	<p>
		If it's a mathematical or geometric problem I like to solve it on paper first against several key
		test cases. I will then code these into a mini program to verify my code. eg:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><i>Do we have the correct answer when our input data is empty?</i></li>
		<li><i>When it has 1 item.</i></li>
		<li><i>When it has 2 items.</i></li>
		<li><i>When it has 3 items.</i></li>
		<li><i>When it has a large number of items.</i></li>
		<li><i>When it has the biggest number of items we reasonably expect to ever handle.</i></li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		If you can write a stand-alone program with one function until you get it right - great! Then you can just
		drop that function in to your program. It always helps to <u>concentrate on the <b>data</b> - not on
			the structure of the program or function's components</u>. Any good Algorithms textbook will tell
		you this. It's easy to do this with C as there isn't any sort of higher-level utility code to
		distract you. To design a function (or algorithm):
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>What does the <b>input set</b> of data look like - be they characters, index numbers for
			triangle vertices, or raw byte values?</li>
		<li>What should the <b>output permutation</b> of data look like. You should know what to expect if
			you look at the bytes in an output array. If you don't, you've gone wrong - start smaller, with just
			one item.</li>
		<li>What is the dumbest/easiest/quickest/dirtiest way to map the input to the output. It's okay to
			have lots of clauses - the pattern will emerge later.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		<b>Don't be afraid to make a mess</b> - you need to get a feel for the problem first. Allow time to
		tidy up later after you have experience with the problem. Iterations where you rewrite things a few
		times are fine. If you try to make "clean" structure first you are wasting time you could be using
		to get experience with the problem. You'll almost always be wrong the first time. Write in such a
		way that it's quick, and you don't mind scrapping it and starting again. Don't try to write generic
		or future-proof code. This is almost never used, takes ages to write, isn't fun, and it's a
		pain to clean up later. Wait until you need to reuse something several times before you do this -
		you'll have a better idea of the ideal structure later. Just make a few iterations reducing the
		amount of code and structure required. Small and unstructured is easy to make generic when you need
		it. Multi-class-multi-function-multi-file stuff is pretty much doomed to be deleted. Allow yourself
		to "go back to the drawing board" a few times.
	</p>

	<p>
		So typically I have something like:
	</p>

	<pre>
int some_test_data[1024];

void my_function( int* data, int number_of_items ) {
  if ( !data ) {
    // handle empty list here
  }
  if ( 0 == number_of_items ) {
    // handle no-op here - maybe just return
  }
  
  // do stuff with data here
}


int main() {
  // test case for empty data:
  init_test_data( 3 ); // some function to set up my input data
  my_function( NULL, 3 );
  print_data( NULL, 3 ); // unit test to make sure output matches expected output

  // test case for one item:
  init_test_data( 1 );
  my_function( some_test_data, 1 );
  print_data( some_test_data, 1 );

  // test case for 3 items:
  init_test_data( 3 );
  my_function( some_test_data, 3 );
  print_data( some_test_data, 3 );

  // ... and so on

  return 0;
}
</pre>

	<h3>Bigger Functions</h3>

	<p>
		Some functions will tend to be bigger. The "<i>update all the people in the simulation</i>" or "<i>draw all the
			trees</i>"
		function has several small jobs. That's right, I don't have: <tt>tree.draw()</tt>.
		It's better to loop over arrays - not have separate, encapsulated items. Where possible. It's easier to
		follow the flow of logic, and keep it in your head (I find). The computer hardware is designed to
		be very efficient at iterating over arrays of data in start-to-finish contiguous order. If you force
		access to be broken up across many small objects you don't get this advantage. You can make a small
		program to test this theory and see just how much faster. It's worth doing.
	</p>

	<p>
		For bigger functions it's a
		pain to separate everything out into small functions, as they tell you to do, and it's then hard to follow
		and you have to do this tedious step-through debugging to find what order things get called. Use long
		functions. Split them up using <tt>{}</tt> blocks.
	</p>

	<pre>
void draw_all_the_things() {
  { // --- trees get drawn here

    // set up GPU state etc for drawing trees - use the correct shaders etc

    drawTreesInstanced( all the trees );

    // or loop over and draw and at a time if required. in a loop:
    for ( int i = 0; i < ntrees; i++ ) {
      draw( trees_array[i] );
    }

  } // --- end of trees block
  
  

  { // this block is something like draw all the rocks
    // similar stuff
  }
  
  

  { // this block is something like draw the water
    // similar stuff
    // in
    // here
  }
  
  

  // ...
  
}
</pre>

	<p>
		Each block has its own scope for variables, so you don't need to worry about mixing them up. If I
		find myself needing to copy-paste a block a few times it's really easy then, to do this:
	</p>

	<pre>
// i just cut and pasted my block and gave it a name
void draw_trees() {

  // set up shader etc here

  drawTreesInstanced( all the trees );

  for ( int i = 0; i < ntrees; i++ ) {
    draw( trees_array[i] );
  }

}

void draw_all_the_things() {
  draw_trees(); // was a block

  // ...
  
  draw_trees(); // presumably i need to do this in a few places now

  // ...
}
</pre>

	<p>
		This is a nice, quick way of slamming code down without getting too messy, splitting up sections,
		and knowing when to split out into functions.
	</p>

	<h3>Multiple Files - Loose Coupling</h3>

	<p>
		I generally group related functions into a file. So when things get bigger I'll have <tt>trees.c</tt>
		with all the functions related to trees. Probably just one <tt>graphics.c</tt> with all the graphics
		functions. In past years the graphics stuff would have been a scene manager class in a scene manager
		file, with some complex inter-class relationships with various other managers for meshes, lighting,
		various inheritance for different types of mesh class... and so on. Now I'm old, tired, and grumpy,
		and want my after-work time to put stuff on the screen, not be whittled away refactoring structure,
		so I'll just have a floating <tt>load_ply_mesh()</tt> function that doesn't give a monkey's uncle
		about any other structure, and there are no managers or special relationships. This is <b>loose-coupling</b>.
		It's very important to building code that scales to a large size without getting tangled and log-jammed.
		It's efficient to add new features to, and doesn't drive you insane. I spend zip-all time thinking about
		the relationships between objects, which is the opposite of how we were trained to make software in college.
	</p>

	<p>
		How long each file or function gets is entirely up to your experience and comfort preferences - more
		experienced coders are happy with longer stuff. Small, elegant solutions to hard problems can be very
		satisfying, but they usually start big and messy. I typically have one or two 'utility' files that
		are used broadly - maybe mathematics, log functions, and so on. Read similar code from others, or
		well known projects, to get improvement and reduction ideas after you've made an attempt.
	</p>

	<p>
		You can do a pseudo-OOP in C if you like. Sometimes it fits, with the nice advantage that it's easy
		to shuffle it around when it doesn't:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><tt>trees.h</tt> - Headers are gross, but you have to use them. This is your interface or class
			declaration equivalent, and comments/usage instructions. And nothing else.</li>

		<li><tt>trees.c</tt> - All the functions and relevant data go in the source file. Globals are like class attributes.
			If you want to make one public/externally accessible - also declare it in the header with the <tt>extern</tt>
			keyword.
			Functions are externally linkable in C (which is silly) - use the <tt>static</tt> keyword in front
			of a function or global to say "private" (prevents linking clashes).</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Build Systems</h3>

	<p>
		All are frustrating. I use the command line until it gets messy, then paste it into a BaSh script.
		Then move to a simple, hand-written, human-readable Makefile. I never needed CMake, package management,
		or other autotools because I don't use any dependencies unless I absolutely have to. You can waste a
		huge amount of time farting about with libraries - it's often quicker to write them yourself if you
		think small, or drop stuff in to your own source code if it's small utilities or libraries.
	</p>

	<h3>Validation and Tools</h3>

	<p>
		I validate all my function parameters, particularly pointers. You can use <tt>assert()</tt> to
		guard any assumptions that you make about acceptable ranges of values. You should do this if eg
		a parameter is going to be used as an index to an array. Strings, parsing functions,
		and indices worth validating. Usually this catches things like when you add a new function two
		weeks later and inadvertently break some assumptions you made earlier.
	</p>

	<pre>
void my_func( int* some_ptr, int some_val ) {
  // validation
  assert( some_val >= 0 );
  if ( !some_ptr ) {
    return; // or do something else
  }

  *some_ptr = some_val + 1; // the function body
}
</pre>

	<p>
		A nice integrated debugger is handy to double check your code. I quite like the C/C++ plug-in for
		Visual Studio Code these days:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Check the number of levels in your function stack - more than three or four at any one time suggests structure
			is getting complex.</li>
		<li>Double-check memory values versus expectations of your algorithm design.</li>
		<li>Find crashes by looking at reverse order (back-trace) of function calls leading to crash.</li>
		<li>Put break points in interesting places to make sure you can follow all your own code as it jumps around,
			or to check when callbacks are called (but use callbacks extremely sparingly).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Clang-format is great for automatically tidying your code. Valgrind is great for finding memory
		issues. Scan-build is a nice linter to find things like overlapping memory access or out-of-bounds
		array indexing.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you're making small memory allocations, consider <tt>alloca()</tt> (look it up, it's handy for
		fast dynamic scratch memory that auto-frees). Otherwise, I use a big pre-allocated block and index into that
		for assets that stay in memory. That way you can free them all in one operation between resets /
		level loads etc, and don't waste time making sure every memory allocation is freed, or writing accounting code
		to track everything or [shudder] a garbage collector.
	</p>

	<h3>Caveats</h3>

	<p>
		<i>"But it doesn't even have feature X from C++, how do you cope?"</i>. The answer is almost
		certainly <i>"just use an array, it was a better choice anyway"</i>, or <i>"write it yourself, it
			will only take a few minutes."</i>, or <i>"no, you don't need it - think simpler - much simpler"</i>.
		Usually these are the right answers for small (and sometimes more complex) projects. Some things
		though, are still god-awful, and you'll have to put up with them. Strings - small problem, big time
		sink.
	</p>

	<h3>The Good Bits</h3>

	<p>
		Using C with no templates, virtual functions, or complex structures means your build times are super
		fast, which is nice for working quickly on side projects. No boilerplate code or cladding code is
		required - this stuff is very time consuming to write and maintain. No getters, setters, patterns,
		etc. Just solve the bite-sized problems that gets your creativity to a visual state. This is very
		motivating. Keep the iteration loop short like this.
	</p>

	<p>
		Yes, you can work even more quickly in other set-ups - I had great fun in game jams with JavaScript + WebGL,
		but I'm very fast at C now and would probably be on par.
		Yes, you can use 'C++ but in C style'. Nobody
		ever does though - it always gets a bit bogged down with the <tt>++</tt> bits getting quite heavy.
		I like the Spartan approach and sacrificing a few comforts. It might make more sense to just show
		live coding of how I work in my after-work hour or two to get a feel for pace and progress. I do
		that sometimes. But I hope this made sense. Minimalism.
