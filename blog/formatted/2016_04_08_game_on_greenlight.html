	<h2>Steam Greenlight - Crongdor the Barbarian</h2>

	<p>
		In the <a href="https://antongerdelan.net/blog/?post=2016_03_24_game_finished">previous post</a> I talked about
		finishing a hobby video game project called
		<b>Crongdor the Barbarian</b>. Yesterday I launched it on Steam Greenlight,
		which is a <i>vote-for-what-should-be-published</i> platform for getting your
		game onto the Steam marketplace proper. I think it should be a very interesting
		experience, and it's certainly exciting! Basically, we need to get a whole
		lot of "YES" votes to get the attention of the Steam staff, and then they
		decide if they will host it or not. So please visit and give us a vote! It's
		free to sign in to Steam and vote:

		My friend Andrea (<a href="https://twitter.com/MScDre">@MScDre</a>) is helping
		me manage everything, which I'm very appreciative of. It's kind of overwhelming
		to try to submit technical/creative work and also balance the many different
		online aspects at once, as well as interact with the public who are judging
		your work, so it's a huge asset to have someone with a bit of experience in
		this area that can maintain some sort of consistent sanity.

		Andrea has set up a website at <a href="crongdor.com">crongdor.com</a>, which I
		am also blogging to, and a Twitter for our little collective: <a
			href="https://twitter.com/rippedwizards">@rippedwizards</a>, and a <a
			href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUZkYNuVxCrL5GYOI2BiiWw">Youtube Channel</a>, and a <a
			href="https://www.facebook.com/crongdor">Facebook page</a>. Talented drama student Romeo has also produced a
		trailer:

		We will see how it goes, and I'll try to report back what I learn from the
		process. In a hobby project there are lots of different elements that may or
		may not go down well in terms of what people expect from the overall
		game experience, and really I've been staring at trees so long that I can't
		see the forest! - It's too hard for me to predict what will happen,
		and that's a lot of fun!
