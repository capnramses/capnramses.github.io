	<h3>Rendering Multiple Objects, Blending</h3>
	<p>
		So, after a lot of pain I figured it out. I booted into Windows and used Chrome's debugging console, which gave me a
		little
		more feedback than Firefox's. This was the key. Using the new error message (attribs not setup properly, causing
		failure of
		<tt>drawArrays</tt>), I trawled the Intertubes. The official documentation was rubbish, but I found a forum post.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			after calling <tt>useProgram</tt> to enable a shader programme for rendering, you must explicitly call
			<tt>enableVertexAttribArray</tt>
			<green>for every and every per-vertex attribute used in the shader</green>
		</li>
		<li>
			after finishing all your <tt>drawArray</tt> calls using that shader, and <green>before switching to a new shader
			</green>,
			you must <green>explicitly disable all vertex attributes that were previously enabled</green> with
			<tt>disableVertexAttribArray</tt>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Wow! How laborious. The on-line tutorials make a complete oversight of this, because they tend not to use a
		different shader, or use a shader
		with the same attributes, and therefore never need to make this switch-over. This is the problem with "<i>learn by
			doing</i>"
		examples, which don't generalise or scale-up well, rather than "<i>explain how each function works in detail</i>"
		instructions.
		My other issue is with Khronos - if the API really must use these antique "bind/unbind", "use", "enable" type of
		functions
		that affect other functions, then it is imperitive to state that in those dependent functions. So often you find
		yourself unsure if a GL object should be bound or not bound when you call a certain function; it leads to (a)
		mystery
		bugs - an avoidable programming obstacle (b) badly written programmes of the "bind everything everywhere" sort.
	</p>

	<p>
		Blending to fake transparency was pretty similar to other GL implementations, but I actually think that the
		tutorials
		on the web are, once again, misleading, and a little incorrect. The most popular series suggests disabled
		depth-sorting,
		which is not correct - disabling <b>depth masking</b> is appropriate technique to use. It also suggests using a
		non-standard
		blend mode. I upgraded my <a href="https://antongerdelan.net/demos/editshaders/">shaders editing demo</a> with these
		new bits and pieces. I might write a tutorial to correct some
		of these traps.
