	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>Making HTML5 Canvas 2d Work Very Hard Indeed</h2>

		<small><i>Using a barycentric algorithm to rasterise and fill a triangle into

	</div>

	<p>
		This morning I had a go at writing my own triangle rasteriser (pictured above),
		in C, using M&ouml;bius' barycentric co-ordinates. Apparently using a variation
		of Bresenham's line-drawing has a faster fill-rate, but I wanted to try
		something new. "Why not make a live on-line one?" I thought - hence, the Canvas
		2d version below. I have the power!

	</div>

	<p>
		I wrote a 3d renderer. You will see in the live demo that I didn't add
		depth-testing - that could be easily done! I don't know what algorithm the
		canvas 2d "fill" uses.

		embed it in this blog feed because security, main thread, etc, etc.
