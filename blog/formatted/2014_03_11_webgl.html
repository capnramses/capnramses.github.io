	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>WebGL Things</h2>

	<h3>Building Modelling/Visualisation Project</h3>

	<p>
		Our building visualisation research project is winding down. There are a few
		bits and pieces that I want to play with before it finishes. First of all, we
		have a little page of demos/experiments from various stages. I keep losing the
		URL when people ask so I'm pasting it here as a self-reminder:
		<a href="http://phaedrus.scss.tcd.ie/buildviz/demo/">http://phaedrus.scss.tcd.ie/buildviz/demo/</a>. Here's my TODO
		list:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Get some experience with the glTF file format (not just for WebGL).</li>
		<li>Get touch-screen web DOM functionality working, see if this means I can
			magically run WebGL nicely on Android, and never need to use the horrific
			ADT/NDK kits ever again (hopefully)</li>
		<li>Look at doing a reliable IFC file &rarr; webgl 3d conversion system</li>
		<li>We're supposed to do some sort of formal evaluation. Need a decent plan
			for that.</li>
		<li>Document everything so that future generations may learn from our mistakes
			(and also have a set of instructions for doing all of this stuff). I'm
			particularly interested in documenting shader tricks and mesh file formats.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Other Stuff Going On</h3>

	<p>
		I've nearly nearly nearly finished my OpenGL tutorials book. Basically I want
		to publish a cheap lab manual that is small and practical, without any
		high-level frameworky stuff obscuring the details. So just an eBook version of
		my tutorials, as well as some more practical "building a bigger one" chapters,
		and some honest opinions on what I've found to be flakey or unreliable across
		implementations (a lot). If I can find a more simplified way to talk about
		loading skinned meshes then I think it will be really useful.
