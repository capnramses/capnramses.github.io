	<h2>Binary Mesh Formats</h2>

	<p>
		I have a fairly stable custom mesh format. I've also been pulling apart overly
		verbose or overly large (in bytes) formats. The next step is to have a look at
		using a binary format. I've never tried this. <tt>fwrite()</tt> is just as
		happy to write data values as it is to write the text version of those values.
		I already have little header lines that say how big blocks should be - already
		suitable for binary format. So I have the following questions:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>How much smaller will the files be when binary-encoded?</li>
		<li>Am I much more vulnerable to parsing errors?</li>
		<li>Are the files much quicker to parse?</li>
		<li>Will I reduce precision or accuracy errors if I encode the atual data of
			<tt>float</tt> values, rather than a text representuation that is limited to
			a certain number of digits?</li>
		<li>Can JavaScript parse these files as readily as C? i.e. Is it still worth
			having a JSON version?</li>
		<li>Could I structure the file in such a way that the entire thing copies
			directly into memory in one big block, without requiring any assembly after
			parsing?</li>
		<li>Exporting from a model editor, do I still need a non-binary format, or can
			these scripts also export sensible binary versions without a lot of trouble?
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		I saw a neat little example <a
			href="http://codeheartjs.com/examples/binarydata/">http://codeheartjs.com/examples/binarydata/</a>.
		I also recently saw something posted on Twitter about a chapter in the OpenGL
		SuperBible [from memory] about a direct-to-memory map for doing this. I should
		probably get a copy of this book.
	</p>

	<h2>OpenGL Tutorial Code</h2>

	<p>
		I've been busy actually following all my OpenGL tutorials to make sure that the
		code works, and fixing any errors and typos. I'm putting together a package of
		all of the demos. There's so many of them! I really should tie this series of
		tutorials up soon. I've been making an e-book version but it's taking forever.
		Hopefully there aren't too many ignorant mis-uses of the GL interface in my
		tutorials. There certainly appears to be a small circle of elite people who
		know an almost secret way of doing things, not using the main interface, but
		using bizarrely-named functions and odd-looking extensions filled with
		in-crowd-only jargon descriptions. Well, they're not very good at sharing this
		information in an easily-digested form, so to hell with it, let's get the
		simple stuff out there! We can worry about the expert-level stuff later.

	<h2>Some Topics That I Should Write Blog Posts On</h2>

	<ul>
		<li>My favourite set of tools for programming, debugging, profiling</li>
		<li>Some techniques that I use for writing multi-platform code</li>
		<li>A rant about why object-oriented programming is a waste of your time,
			and how I got to be a really speedy programmer by un-learning most of my
			education</li>
		<li>Some issues that I found with OpenGL on different platforms (Apple esp.)</li>
		<li>A post-mortem on making my 2d WebGL game. Why WebGL is awesome, and some
			cautionary notes about JavaScript.</li>
		<li>Profiling the GPU time taken by GL functions, using queries, and something
			about the awesome Apitrace programme.</li>
		<li>Some code conventions that I use, or "my latest spin on C++--"</li>
		<li>Some electronics stuff! Maybe turning an old CPU power supply into a
			multi-voltage supply for projects?</li>
	</ul>
