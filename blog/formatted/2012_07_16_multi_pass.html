	<h3>Post-Processing and Computer Vision Algorithms on the GPU</h3>
	<p>
		Well, it looks like post-processing image techniques are a lot easier than I had envisioned. It's more or less the
		same set-up as the colour-picker demo that I did last week, but the intermediate buffer's texture gets re-used as an
		input to a simple full-screen quad. The quad samples the texture, and performs whatever image technique within the
		fragment shader. Things like changing the colour range are pretty straight-forward. I was interested in OpenCV-like
		computer vision techniques. The trick here is just to do several texture samples around the fragment's texture
		coordinates to create your sliding window/image kernel. e.g. for a 3x3 kernel:

	<p>
		So, probably not a lot of use for post-processing techniques out side of entertainment, but I wonder if it's
		worth-while to look at doing some of our computer vision tasks (currently done in OpenCV) on the GPU. I am thinking
		that this might be handy for the special case of analyse-visualise. The question there is - what is the best way to
		grab camera frames and feed them to GL? Do I want to stream them in one-at-a-time (slow), or do a bunch at a time?
		This raises some interesting questions (and possibilities) in a web set-up. Perhaps the camera can talk to a web
		server, and WebGL can fetch frames interactively from the server (and skip anything non-current). Must try.

	<h3>Depth of Field</h3>

	<p>
		Okay, so I've figured out how to blur the area of a screen around a certain object's position on the screen. But
		this isn't true depth of field - a technique which actually uses depth information to focus on a particular object
		and blur the forward/rear elements. Annoyingly, the WebGL book that I got has a picture of a depth of field
		technique on the cover...and that was a main reason for buying the book...but it's just a picture. I judged a book
		by its cover...
		Anyway here are some enlightening sources of information;

			And a rather nice elaboration with clear diagrams about doing it in a general way (distorting the camera position
			for objects around the focus):
