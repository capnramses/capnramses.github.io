	<h3>Wavefront .obj to JSON Mesh Conversion</h3>

	<div class="centre">

	</div>

	<p>
		Here is my "dungeon door" test mesh that I use instead of teapots. It was really easy to convert an .obj to JSON
		format in the end; I didn't need to use an exporter or a Python
		script, I just re-used my C .obj parser code and got it to write all the vertex points to a JSON file. Excellent.
		I'll upload the programme when it's a little more fully-featured.
		Now...textures.

	<h3>Texture Loading</h3>

	<div class="centre">
		<a href="https://antongerdelan.net/demos/textures/">
			<img src="../images/textures.png" width="512" /></a><br />
		<i><small>The main problem was that tutorial content on the web has some mistakes! Unbinding a texture during an
				'onload' style callback can interrupt and cause black rendering.</small></i>
	</div>

	<p>
		That was easy enough! I made my parser export another JSON array (remembering to put a comma after the first array),
		containing texture coordinates. Then some fairly standard
		GL texture binding and loading, except that you can use the Javascript <tt>Image()</tt> object to load the image
		from a URL. In the shaders I had to use the <tt>varying</tt> keyword,
		instead of the <tt>in</tt> and <tt>out</tt> keywords that I'm used to for transferring between the vertex shader and
		fragment shader. Texture sampling was the same. The only other
		issue was that I used bi-linear filtering here, but it looks like tri-linear filtering and mip-maps require
		extensions to be loaded;

	<h3>Next...</h3>

	<p>
		Perhaps some Phong lighting shaders using normals. I also need to think about refactoring these demos into a
		semi-stable engine where I can re-use the data-structures for
		many objects/textures/matrices at once. Some manager objects will probably be required. Maybe I should look at
		extension loading as well.
