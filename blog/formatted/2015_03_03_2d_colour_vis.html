	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>The Problems of Colour</h2>

	<p>
		My colleagues suggested a 2d visualisation in a lattice of coloured tiles,
		where the colour of a tile indicates its value. Red, green? They suggested.
		Anyone who was on-line last week has seen the issues relating to colour and
		perception! I initially visualised their experiment results with shades of
		green, and then mixes of green and red. I'm green-red colour-blind, so I could
		see straight away the problem with that. Even shades of a single colour is
		confusing. If you look at a mixed dark/light region, and then a mostly dark
		or mostly light region your relative judgment of colour change shifts.
		Different people perceive different colours differently.
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mach_bands">Mach banding</a> pops out
		where colours or gradients change. Different displays have different colour
		'temperatures' or profiles. Some are darker, some are blue-er or red-er. Does
		the browser gamma-correct the colour output or not? <b>Displays do not have
			linear colour outputs</b>. You can't use these visualisations in a sensible
		way.

	<p>
		A further issue is that there are <u>only 255 shades of any particular
			colour</u> on most image buffers. That's not enough shades - we won't to find clusters of
		like-values here. With a source document of 60,000+ segments, there is a huge
		range of quite separate segments that will have the exact same colour, and
		many more that are so close that your eye won't tell the difference!
	</p>

	<p>
		I feel that these very obvious and easy-to-avoid problems are mindlessly
		repeated by analytics 'experts' (Google Analytics is a worst-offender in the
		realm of bad visualisations). But what's the best idea in this case, where
		we want to find grouped clusters of similar intensities or values? Perhaps
		a 1d configuration but with some sort of zoom is more reasonable. From Tufte
		et. al. we know that comparisons of line lengths in one dimension and direction
		is a more reliable perceptial guide than colour - perhaps a very long bar
		chart that also scales or zooms? Perhaps more aggregation or passes over the
		data are necessary to identify groups of values to be highlighted to the
		reader. Perhaps setting this against a symbolic document page will help
		visualise the position of the segment clusters in the whole corpus?
