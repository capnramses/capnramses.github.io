	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>Preparing for 2015</h2>

	<h3>Micro-Projects</h3>

	<p>
		In the quiet period before everyone got back to work I decided to organise some
		of the bits and pieces of experimental code that I'd worked on over the last
		year. Mostly this has involved putting stuff on GitHub and tidying up messy
		code into tighter demos. I made some WebGL ports of some of my OpenGL code,
		and created some drop-ins or "starting point" demos that I thought would be
		handy for work this year.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>OpenGL Text Rendering</li>
		<li>WebGL Text Rendering</li>
		<li>OpenGL Wavefront .obj Renderer</li>
		<li>WebGL Wavefront .obj Renderer</li>
		<li>My Custom .apg 3d Skinned Mesh Format and Tools</li>
		<li>Maths Functions for 3d Graphics in C++ and JavaScript</li>
		<li>My "Dolphin Rescue" WebGL game</li>
		<li>My "Mountain King" WebGL game</li>
		<li>Created a user key-binding configuration tool</li>
		<li>Started a WebGL depth-of-field demo</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		All of these are on <a href="https://github.com/capnramses">https://github.com/capnramses</a>.

	<h3>Objectives First Half 2015</h3>

	<p>
		My teaching semester is officially over and reverting to research mode. I put
		everything into that and more than 100% of my work time so it should be a bit
		less hectic now. Not really resolutions, but small goals for this half-year:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Small visualisation papers</li>
		<li>Work on book chapters</li>
		<li>Finish major game project?</li>
		<li>Grow knowledge in cache and hardware usage / optimisation techniques</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		I haven't published a scientific paper in ages - although my book publication
		last year was a major victory - it would be nice to switch thinking style for
		a bit.
	</p>

	<p>
		For reasons I can't quite explain I work about 10x more efficiently on my
		little side projects than on the _same tasks_ for my main projects. I think the
		best course of action is to keep doing both simultaneously.
	</p>

	<h3>Games Page</h3>

	<p>
		Made a list of my games on <a href="https://antongerdelan.net/games/">https://antongerdelan.net/games/</a>. Why not?
	</p>

	<p>
		I finished the Test Drive game and am down from 3 to 2 current game projects;
		Crongdor the Barbarian (OpenGL), and Secret Project (WebGL).
