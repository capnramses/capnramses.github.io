	<h2>Modding a '90s Game Boy</h2>

	<p>
		I bought an original Game Boy off eBay. I never had one, but I was curious, and
		wanted to see what all the retro stuff in games these days was alluding to.
		It's in some ways a clever little design. Everything is supremely well put
		together, all the components and cartridges have a nice design, and it's
		unbelievably robust for a piece of electronics. Twenty or so years later and
		it still works perfectly.
	</p>

	<p>
		The downside is the awful, awful LCD-like dot matrix display. It requires
		very strong direct sunlight to see anything at all. This is in the days before
		back-lit digital displays, which was surprising. We don't have very strong
		direct sunlight in Ireland, so it's basically impossible to use. With the lights
		on inside at night you can almost see the detail when you hold it on an
		awkward angle and never move it. There is a contrast knob on the side which is
		basically just there to torment you. I thought it must just be a worn-out
		display so I did some reading, and yep, they were actually all that bad.
		Nintendo produced a whole series of crappy half-measures that you bought to
		attach to the top until you have a giant lights-and-shades thing on the top
		that looks like a prop from Ghostbusters.

		I've been brushing-up my electronics skills lately, and my Arduino kit still
		hasn't arrived, so I was half-thinking of modifying it to begin with. The
		natural first option was installing a back light for the display. First I had
		to get a tri-wing screwdriver to undo Nintendo's custom screws.

		I bought a little thin 4x mini LED back-light panel that would fit in behind the
		display, but first I would have to strip off the reflective backing from the
		original display. This was no small task. I couldn't lift up the display more
		than about 1cm to get to the back because of non-removable strip connections
		on two sides of the panel. What I did was start peeling it off with the help of
		a scalpel, but only the plastic padding came off, and the silvered reflective
		coating mostly stayed stuck fast to the glass panel. Boy was that hard to get
		off. I used my Science Gallery membership card to scrape it off. It took ages.
		Then there was still a bunch of smeary glue stuck all over the glass.

		The arts shop across the road was no help for spirits, but I told my story to
		the pharmacist and she was infinitely more helpful. So I got make-up remover
		cotton balls and nail-polish remover. I think that she believed me...anyway
		that got the glue off. I cut some bits of the plastic casing out to make room
		for the wires, and soldered them on to +6V and 0V points on the boards. I got
		this piece of polarised film that is supposed to go in-between the display and
		the front of the case. It definitely works when you turn it 90 degrees, which
		is pretty neat, but it seemed to work just fine without it, and is actually
		a bit brighter. Material on the web seemed to suggest that it wouldn't work
		without it...not sure about that, maybe there was an existing polarised film
		already stuck to my display? In any case it came in contact with the nail
		polish remover, and then my decision was made for me.
	</p>

	<p>
		I polished the bejaysus out of all the panels and got all the smudginess off
		them using the lady products. Much clearer.

				suggests. No idea how much quicker it will drain the batteries though.</i></small>
	</div>

	<p>
		It works amazingly well. I went with a yellow light because the other colours
		didn't look quite as bright to me. If memory serves me correctly blue LEDs
		tend to require a slightly higher voltage and current, which is probably why
		they didn't look as good. Red may have been even brighter, but this is bright
		enough and looks kind of retro (ugly in a throw-back charming way?).
