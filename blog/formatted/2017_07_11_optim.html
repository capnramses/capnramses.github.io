	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>3D Graphics Optimisation Resources</h2>

	<p>
		I am collecting optimisation guides, tools, and resources for
		3D graphics programming, with particular focus on OpenGL. I'll put these on
		my OpenGL page in a little article when I have collected a few resources.
		I'll update this post as I get more things. Send me a message if you have a
		suggestion!
	</p>

	<p>
		Nicholas Guillemot's "Programmable Pulling" (<a
			href="https://twitter.com/nlguillemot/status/884581084448542722">tweet)(<a
				href="https://t.co/dNphDLmLqL">github</a>)
			comparison tool caught my eye, and he mentions optimisation guides from
			vendors. I think this is a good start!
	</p>

	<h3>Vendor Optimisation Guides</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>Intel - <a href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-graphics-developers-guides">html</a></li>
		<li>Intel - Praveen K., "OpenGL Performance Tips", Aug 2016 - <a
				href="https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/opengl-performance-tips-avoid-opengl-calls-that-synchronize-cpu-and-gpu">html/pdf</a>
		</li>
		<li>Apple - pretty sure there are guides on their developer pages (TODO)</li>
		<li>Apple - Tech Note TN2093 - 2013-06-07 - <a
				href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/technotes/tn2093/_index.html">html</a> - is there a more
			recent one?</li>
		<li>Apple - Best Practices for Working with Vertex Data (OpenGL ES) <a
				href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/3DDrawing/Conceptual/OpenGLES_ProgrammingGuide/TechniquesforWorkingwithVertexData/TechniquesforWorkingwithVertexData.html">html</a>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Tools and Tool Guides</h3>

	<p>
		I will also collect profilers, tracers etc. I think it would be better to have
		a guide/tutorial for how to optimise with a tool than just a list of tools.
		e.g. I recently followed a guide on how to check for overdraw with RenderDoc.
	</p>

	<p>
		I might write a little tutorial on how I do on-screen CPU + GPU timers/queries
		for different engine subsystems.
	</p>

	<h3>Programmatic Techniques</h3>

	<p>
		It might be nice to have a list of articles about e.g. culling and spatial
		data structures but perhaps pointing to collections of these is better e.g.
		which books cover a range of these.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>[OpenGL] Daniel RÃ¡kos, <i>"Programmable Vertex Pulling"</i> OpenGL Insights chapter 21 <a
				href="http://openglinsights.com/">book website</a>.</li>
		<li>[OpenGL] Cass Everitt <i>et al. "Approaching Zero Driver Overhead"</i>, GDC 14 - <a
				href="http://gdcvault.com/play/1020791/">video</a>.</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>Benchmarks and Comparisons</h3>

	<p>
		Things like Nicolas' project would be a nice thing to link here. I also think
		eg slides of presentations comparing vertex data arrangement strategies would
		be a good fit. It's hard to get hard data on which techniques actually do offer
		some improvement - and how much - so that we can tell if it's worth the time
		investment or extra code. Anything like that can go here.
