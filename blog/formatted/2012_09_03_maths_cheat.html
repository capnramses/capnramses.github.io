	<h3>3d Maths Cheat Sheet</h3>
	<p>
		After failing to correctly remember some vector/angle conversion formula and going back to re-read my own lecture
		slides (this happens all the time...) I decided that it was time to write a look-up cheat sheet for these things;
	</p>

		<i><small>
				A set of commonly used 3d maths and linear algebra formulae for those like me - with a brain that tends to
				delete this stuff from memory immediately. Click image for .pdf.

	<h3>3d camera vis</h3>

	<p>
		I have to switch back to working on buildings again soon, so my tie-it-up plan for the 3d camera visualisation is:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			switch from 2d particles to 3d meshes (or maybe resize the particles with z) for the faces so that you can see the
			depth
		</li>
		<li>
			detect nods (y) and shakes (x) of heads and derive the frequency and amplitude. then I can say "if f > some
			threshold then head is nodding 'Yes'".
		</li>
		<li>
			print out these tracking stats either in text or with some sort of real-time graph
		</li>
		<li>
			clean up the camera feed and track the face positions so that the characters are never mixed up
		</li>
		<li>
			write up a technical report as a workshop style "this is how you visualise 3d data with webgl, and this is how
			hard it is to do" sort of thing.
		</li>
	</ul>
