	<h2>Released Crongdor the Barbarian</h2>

	<p>
		A week ago I finished a video game project called <b>Crongdor the Barbarian</b>
		(<a href="https://capnramses.itch.io/crongdor">https://capnramses.itch.io/crongdor</a>)
		that I've been working on in my spare time since about 2010! It's an absurdly
		violent, fast-paced action game with my little cartoon drawings thrown into a
		3d environment. The name is a mash up of
		<a href="http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks13/1303751h.html">Conan the Barbarian</a> and
		<a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/trogdor.html">Trogdor the Burninator</a>.
		It was going to be a working title, but I kind of got attached to the silliness
		of it!

	<p>
		The original
		prototype was written against a graphics engine called <a href="http://www.ogre3d.org/">Ogre3d</a>,
		and designed to run on my tiny Asus EEE notebook and be quick enough to write in
		my spare time. Since then I re-wrote it from the ground up when I was teaching myself OpenGL. I've always
		wanted to publish a little hobby game that has a price tag, and I think
		experimenting with an OpenGL e-book gave me a lot of confidence to do that.
		Right now it's just on little indie site itch.io,
		but I'm going to try to get it on Steam so that more people see it - why not?

	<p>
		Finishing a video game is extremely difficult - the most work I've ever put
		into anything. More hours and creativity and self-discipline and tenacity and
		sacrifice are required than completing a computer science PhD.
		I'll try to put out some more blog posts describing how I implemented
		different features, because I think it will be interesting for people to read
		that are learning OpenGL or programming. It's hard to know in advance where
		complexity is, and just how much time or fiddling around is involved in
		different aspects. I also found a lot of shortcuts and broke a lot of the rules
		that we were taught at college, so that might be amusing too.

		The kind of things I might talk about are:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>implementing various graphics techniques on top of OpenGL</li>
		<li>managing a programme with lots of different OpenGL elements and states</li>
		<li>low-level C programming without using an IDE</li>
		<li>quality control with debugging, static analysis, valgrind, memory leak checks, etc.</li>
		<li>developing on and for 4 different desktop platforms {linux 32 and 64-bit,
			windows, OS X}</li>
		<li>writing your own 2d/3d audio code, and using audio libraries</li>
		<li>how to work efficiently with your limited spare time</li>
		<li>some mistakes, time-sinks, and misconceptions I learned from</li>
		<li>packaging asset files into binaries</li>
		<li>very light-weight pseudo-script files</li>
		<li>some annoying limitations of C and C++</li>
		<li>managing assets like textures and meshes loaded from files</li>
		<li>robust shader management (aka improving OpenGL's crappy shader interface)</li>
	</ul>
