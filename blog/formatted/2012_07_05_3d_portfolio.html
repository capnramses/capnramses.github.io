	<h3>3d models portfolio viewer</h3>
	<p>
		I wrote a little <a href="../3dmodelviewer/">show-case tool</a> to view different 3D models. An animated .gif might
		be okay, but I think that I will make it interactive and integrate some "play animation 2" type of buttons. I have
		to develop a decent animation system for hardware skinning anyway. It's quite a lot of work putting the content
		together, but that's the same for all websites I guess.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">

			<img src="../images/showcase.png" width="512"><br />
		</a>
		<small><i>The web page allows you to browse a selection of 3d models, and display some additional information of
				interest. I will add some sort of animations support.</i></small>
	</div>

	<h3>future activities</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			look at graphs and charts in webgl. is it easier to use javascript or php for 2d charts? what cool 3d
			visualisations can i do?
		</li>
		<li>
			get some sort of audio API working to go with the talking head.
		</li>
		<li>
			make a hardware skinning demo. I'll need to come up with a custom JSON format for storing animations.
		</li>
		<li>
			I should really come back and finish that 3D picking demo(s)...
		</li>
