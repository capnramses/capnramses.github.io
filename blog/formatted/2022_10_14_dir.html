	<h2>Reading Filesystem Directory Contents in C</h2>

	<!-- TODO image here

	<p>This post explains how I wrote directory-reading code for use in C, with links to working code.</p>

	<h3>The Operating System Portability Problem</h3>

	<p>
		It's a common task to have program read a user-specified directory for loading data from user files.
		The
		C and its standard libraries include a file I/O interface, but there isn't a full interface for reading filesystem
		directories.
	</p>

	<p>
		Operating system-portable libraries for C are taken care of by the POSIX libraries, and there is a directory
		interface in POSIX; <tt>dirent.h</tt>.
		POSIX libraries are unfortunately are not fully implemented by Microsoft Windows for the MSVC compiler, where there
		is instead an equivalent Win32 interface. This includes directories, threads, and there are similar issues with
		socket-level networking.
		To make fully portable C code we then abstract over both interfaces.
	</p>

	<p>
		I handle small, common, tasks like this in my <a
			href="https://github.com/capnramses/apg/tree/master/apg"><tt>apg.h</tt></a> snippets file that I drag around
		between projects, which is quite a common approach in C-land.
	</p>

	<h3>Abstracting Operating Systems</h3>

	<p>
		Generally in C you can use the pre-processor to detect the operating system, or the compiler. Here, you have a
		choice to use POSIX on Windows if GCC is used. Either strategy works:
	</p>

	<code>
		#ifdef _WIN32
			// All compilers on Windows using Win32 calls.
		#else
			// Other operating systems use POSIX calls here.
		#endif
	</code>

	<code>
		#ifdef _MSC_VER
			// Only MSVC using Win32 calls.
		#else
			// Non-Microsoft compilers, including GCC on Windows, using POSIX.
		#endif
	</code>

	<p>
		These compiler branches will be used to determine header files, and also inside your wrapper functions.
	</p>

	<h3>POSIX Code</h3>

	<p>Here's a minimal version, with no validation. I'll mention additional steps I took later.</p>

	<code>#ifndef _MSC_VER

#include <dirent.h>

void print_dir_contents( const char* path_ptr ) {
	struct dirent* entry_ptr;
  DIR* dir_ptr = opendir( path_ptr );

  while ( ( entry_ptr = readdir( dir_ptr ) ) ) {
		printf( "%s\n", entry_ptr->d_name );
	}

  closedir( dir_ptr );
}

#endif</code>

	<h3>Win32 Code</h3>

	<p>Again, with validation removed:</p>

	<code>#ifndef _MSC_VER

#include <windows.h> // You could reduce the size of this include with Windows macro tricks.

void print_dir_contents( const char* path_ptr ) {
	char tmp[2048];
	WIN32_FIND_DATA fdFile;
  HANDLE hFind = NULL;
	sprintf( tmp, "%s/*.*", path_ptr ); // Specify a file mask. "*.*" means we want everything!
	if ( ( hFind = FindFirstFile( tmp, &fdFile ) ) == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE ) { return; } // Error.
	do {
		printf( "%s\n", fdFile.cFileName );
	} while ( FindNextFile( hFind, &fdFile ) );
	FindClose( hFind );
}

#endif</code>

	<h3>Caveats and Improvements</h3>

	<p>
		There are several snags I discovered here:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>MinGW GCC couldn't handle trailing slashes in supplied paths. MSVC could.</li>
		<li>User-supplied directory strings may need to be converted to Unix-style slashes.</li>
		<li>When collecting an array of contents, it's slightly tricky to get the number of directory entries to
			pre-allocate for. I did another loop to count the number of entries first.</li>
		<li>You may want to check if an entry is a file, a directory, or another type. This requires some more
			platform-branching code.</li>
		<li>Determining symbolic links doesn't usually work, so I settled on 'file' and 'directory' as the types of entry.
		</li>
		<li>The entries are not necessarily given in alphabetical order, so you may want to sort them.</li>
		<li>Determining a file's size or type is best done with <tt>stat</tt>, which does not require opening or reading
			through the file. Using stat portably is quite tricky. See my code for how I abstract that also.</li>
	</ul>
