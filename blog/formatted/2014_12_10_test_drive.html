	<h2>OpenGL Test Drive Remake</h2>

	<p>
		I've been lecturing computer graphics this semester. The students have to do a
		large assignment where they make a game in OpenGL. I thought I'd make one too
		as a kind of demonstration of how to use various techniques in OpenGL, and the
		process I would use to make a larger programme fit together in steps. Also
		because it was fun.
	</p>

	<p>
		<b>In the late 1980s my cousin had a computer with games</b>. My brother and I
		thought that this was amazing. He had a very primitive car game called "Test
		Drive", which had CGA graphics featuring magenta cliffs and cyan sky. It was
		like driving through a surreal nightmare world. I decided to remake this game
		in OpenGL,
		<u>with CGA-styled graphics</u>.

	<p><b>Requires OpenGL 4.2 capable drivers and hardware</b>. I deliberately used modern interface features to

		Unfortunately OpenGL has no mechanism to update the library interface for older hardware.</p>

	<p>
		I believe that this is my third completed game, after WebGL games Dolphin
		Rescue, and Mountain King.
	</p>

	<h2>Controls</h2>

	<p>
		To play the original game you had to first get into gear from neutral, then
		accelerate. The same applies here. If you over-rev the engine the car explodes.
		In the original the windscreen would inexplicably shatter. I have preserved
		this feature.

	<h2>Road and Cliffs</h2>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/tdrive_road.png" /><br />
		<p><small>
				I started with a basic 3d mesh viewer and put 2 triangles and a texture to
				make a road segment.
			</small></p>
	</div>

	<p>
		I started by creating a road segment with a very basic texture. I hard-coded
		the creation of the triangles for the road. I then put this in a loop to
		extend the road to many segments. I have a single, simple shader for the road.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/tdrive_roadloop.png" /><br />
		<p><small>
				Several road segments, with random X offsets at segment ends. A cliff is added
				to the side of each segment. It has a special shader to do the hatching effect
				in screen-space.
			</small></p>
	</div>

	<p>
		I extended my road's length in a loop, and added some random variation to the
		X position at the end/start of each segment, using the <tt>rand()</tt>
		function. I wanted to add a few natural kinks to the segments. I also started
		to add the cliff wall using the same loop and X positions as the right side of
		the road. I added an additional segment to the top of the cliff, and leaned to
		further back along the X axis, so that the cliff looked a bit less sheer. If
		you look at the original CGA graphics, they had a really horrible
		cross-hatching effect to make some parts look like they were a different shade
		of magenta. I didn't want to just use a texture, because that might actually
		start to look good - I wanted the cross-hatching to be in screen space, like
		the original. In a new fragment shader, I used the built-in
		<tt>gl_FragCoord</tt> variable to determine the on-screen pixel coordinates of
		each fragment of cliff-face. If it was on an odd-numbered horizontal fragment,
		and an even-numbered vertical fragment, or <i>vice versa</i>, I made it black.
		It was pretty easy to add the left-hand side cliff face using the same method.
		I also created an array of these road lengths (of about 16 straight segments
		each) - enough for a whole level.
	</p>

	<p>
		To add some interesting variations to my course, I randomly decided if each
		set of every 4 road lengths was going to be a "straight", a "left turn", or a
		"right turn". For the turns I added the first part of a sine-wave to my X
		offsets to give a gradual turn. This resulted in much more interesting-looking
		terrain, and also ensured some long, straight bits that would allow the player
		to get up to a really high speed.
	</p>

	<p>
		As I build my road mesh, I record the positions of the start and end of each
		segment, so that I can later use this for path-finding and collision-detection.
	</p>

	<h2>Player's Dashboard</h2>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/tdrive_blendering.png" /><br />
		<p><small>
				Creating a car interior in Blender.
			</small></p>
	</div>

	<p>
		I decided to push the envelope and do a 3d car interior for the player. I move
		this along with the camera. If you were to view from outside you would see a
		disembodied dashboard driving along the road. I wanted to limit myself to just
		one of the drivable cars from the original, so I tried to copy the style of
		one of the original's interiors (I'm not sure which car model it is). I just
		made a really simple mesh in Blender with box-modelling and extrusion.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/tdrive_dash.png" /><br />
		<p><small>
				The in-game view. I used another cross-hatching shader, similar to the cliffs,
				but with cyan. I darken based on the dot product of the normal with the
				direction to the camera, so that front-facing surfaces are lighter. I also
				added a little bit of darken-by-depth to all my fragment shaders, which made
				the scene "pop" a bit more.
			</small></p>
	</div>

	<p>
		The original had some pretty neat dynamic dashboard elements, so I thought I'd
		make a few interesting gauges too. The steering wheel in the original sucked -
		I decided to do a full 3d rotating wheel instead of re-creating the weird
		moving-dot mechanism that games at that time employed. A really interesting
		feature of the original was the rear-vision mirror. I thought that would be
		pretty neat to do in OpenGL.
	</p>

	<p>
		I wrote a very simple Wavefront .obj loader for loading all the meshes in the
		game. You can find that in the source-code.
	</p>

	<h3>Rear-Vision Mirror</h3>

	<p>
		You could do this with another viewport, but I wanted to fit it to an
		interesting, non-rectangular shaped mirror. I render the scene again, but with
		the camera facing to the rear. I use a secondary framebuffer to draw this to a
		texture instead of to the screen. In my normal, forward-facing, rendering, I
		draw a mesh for the mirror, and sample the texture from the other framebuffer
		to fit across the mirror.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/tdrive_mirror.png" /><br />
		<p><small>
				I drew the scene again with a rear-facing camera, and rendered this to a
				texture. When drawing the normal scene I sample that texture onto the mirror.
				I had to flip this horizontally so that it was actually mirrored, and not just
				what a rear-facing person would see!
			</small></p>
	</div>

	<p>
		The problem with this idea, is that <b>this is not a mirrored projection!</b>
		So the mirror had the cliffs on the left-hand-side! I just inverted the
		horizontal texture coordinate to address this.
	</p>

	<h3>Steering Wheel</h3>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/tdrive_wheel.png" /><br />
		<p><small>
				I rotate my steering wheel with a Z-axis rotation matrix, based on the current
				steering angle. This is very smooth when using analogue thumb-stick controls.
			</small></p>
	</div>

	<p>
		I created a mesh for the steering wheel, with a similar shader to the
		dashboard, except also with a simple texture. The wheel is rotated based on the
		current steering angle.
	</p>

	<h3>Tachometer</h3>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/tacho_empty.png" width="256" /><img src="../images/tacho_full.png" width="256" /><br />
		<p><small>
				The "emtpy" tachometer image (left), and "full" (right). Depending on my
				current RPM, I'll decide if a fragment should sample from the empty or full
				texture.
			</small></p>
	</div>

	<p>
		In the original game, the engine blew up with your RPMs went to high and you
		forgot to change gears. To indicate how high your RPMs are you need some sort
		of visible feedback. I also added audio feedback, but more on that later. I
		decided to do a multi-texturing job for a '70s-ish retro-looking "futuristic"
		dashboard panel. I have 2 textures; empty RPM, and full RPM. I have a simple
		shader that takes a uniform float factor of engine RPM from 0.0 to 1.0. Because
		my gauge is horizontal, I can just make everything to the left of the RPM
		factor (as a factor of horizontal position) use the "full" texture, and
		everything to the right use the "empty" texture. So if the RPM factor is 0.5,
		then the left half is coloured with the full texture, and the right half with
		the empty.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/tdrive_tacho.png" /><br />
		<p><small>
				The tachometer at about a factor of 0.8. The left 8/10ths of the gauge sample
				from the "full" texture.
			</small></p>
	</div>

	<h3>Speedometer and Gear Indicator</h3>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/tdrive_speedo.png" /><br />
		<p><small>
				The speedometer was easy to do - just a rotating needle mesh over the top of
				texture meter. I got lazy and just switch between numbered textures for the
				gear indicator.
			</small></p>
	</div>

	<p>
		An analogue (needle) speedometer would have been tricky to make in raster
		graphics, but I don't need to even think about it here - I have a simple,
		textured mesh for the meter, and another mesh for the needle. I rotate this
		between -90 and +90 degrees based on the current speed in kilometers per hour
		up to 300 (I've also changed the game to metric).
	</p>

	<p>
		The gear indicator just uses 6 different textures {N, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, and I
		swap these as I change gears. This was a bit lazy - a single image containing
		all 6 sub-images would be more professional. For all my single-plane meshes
		I use "attribute-less" rendering where I don't have a vertex buffer of mesh
		points - they are hard-coded in an array in the shader and I index the
		appropriate one <i>via</i> the built-in <tt>gl_VertexId</tt> variable.
	</p>

	<h2>Road Traffic</h2>

	<h3>Meshes, Textures, and Animation</h3>

	<p>
		The trucks are just boxes stuck together in Blender. I generated texture
		coordinates from projections, exported an outlines image from Blender,
		drew over this quickly in GIMP, and used that as my texture. The wheels
		I deliberately made separate meshes, as part of a simple animation demo.
		These are animated by a parent-child relationship with the truck body
		(the parent) and offset from the centre to each of the four positions.
		The wheels continually rotate over time around their local X axis. They
		don't actually stop rotating. This is done with a matrix multiplication
		hierarchy.
	</p>

	<P>
		The texture was very simple, and as I didn't need any transparency, I
		thought it would be neat to use the alpha channel as a factor for an
		<b>emission map</b>. The fragment shader uses an interpolating
		<tt>mix()</tt> with the alpha channel to mix the full-colour texel with
		the distance-darkened texel. I used this on the head and tail lights
		to give the illusion of lights.
	</p>

	<h3>Lane-Following</h3>

	<p>
		As I was generating the road I created an array containing the start/end
		position of each straight segment. I offset this to either side of the Z
		axis to get the middle of each lane. One lane's direction counts up from
		zero, and one counts down to zero.
	</p>

	<p>
		I start each truck at a specific node index along a particular lane.
		Each truck heads in a straight line direction to the next lane marker
		from the array. When closer than 1m it updates its "current" node to
		the next index, and rotates to face the new target. This creates rather
		linear, blocky movement, which suits the game entirely.
	</p>

	<h3>Crash Detection</h3>

	<p>
		I just use a straight-line distance between player and trucks to
		determine crashes - under a certain distance is a crash. I use squared
		distances to reduce computational cost. I can easily test all the trucks,
		every step without any real overhead problem.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you crash with the traffic, or with the cliffs or edge, or blow up the
		engine, the windscreen shows an alpha-blended "smashed" version, like in the
		original for a delay of about 3s, then puts you back on the road in a hopefully
		sensible position at the nearest segment end-point. The delay hurts your
		overall time.
	</p>

	<h2>Car Physics/Mechanical Simulation</h2>

	<P>
		A simple time-step model is used to update anything that moves in the game. I
		use a time-step of 0.02s (50Hz) for simulation. I accumulate elapsed time every
		frame of rendering in a counter, and then:
	</p>

	<textarea rows=6>
// work out simulation time steps
while (accum_sim_time > TIME_STEP_SIZE) {
  accum_sim_time -= TIME_STEP_SIZE;
  update_player (TIME_STEP_SIZE);
  update_traffic (TIME_STEP_SIZE);
}</textarea>

	<p>
		During my PhD I came up with a mechanical simulation model for cars. I thought,
		since I haven't even opened my thesis since then, that I'd re-implement that.
		I actually found some code from 2008 and re-wrote that for my engine sim. If
		I'm honest about it, it was more fun to play <U>before</u> I added the
		realistic driving. I found the actual stats (gear ratios, wind-tunnel values
		etc.) for a Lamborghini Countach and plugged these in to the game.
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Every simulation update works out a new angular speed of the wheels, w = car speed / wheel radius in rpm</li>
		<li>The rpm up the drive train at the gear is gear_rpm = w * differential ratio</li>
		<li>The rpm at the motor is motor_rpm = selected_gear_ratio * gear_rpm. I store the gear ratios in an array</li>
		<li>The motor rpm is adjusted to <b>never go below a minimum</b> (this is very important or you can never start
			moving) or above a maximum rpm. If above the engine blows up.</li>
		<li>The torque at the motor is derived from the rpm using a torque curve function. I just use a sine wave to model
			this.</li>
		<li>The motor torque is factored by the throttle control between 0 and 1 using the gas pedal</li>
		<li>I work out the torque at the wheels by multiplying back down the drive train of gears to the wheel, and get
			linear force by dividing this by wheel radius.</li>
		<li>A blanket mechanical efficiency value factors the torque output</li>
		<li>Rolling resistance force is calculated using known rolling resistance of the car with racing tyres, the mass,
			and gravity</li>
		<li>Drag is calculated using an air density constant, the current speed of the car squared, and known wind-tunnel
			properties of the car.</li>
		<li>Resistance forces are subtracted from linear force</li>
		<li>Acceleration of the car = force / mass</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		I keep track of the currently selected gear (an integer) which looks up gear
		ratios from an array. When RPM of the engine gets very high or very low the
		player must change gear. I change the pitch of the engine sound based on the
		current speed (rpm) of the engine.
	</p>

	<h2>Sound and Music</h2>

	<p>
		For my first time I tried the IrrKlang library for audio. I quite liked the
		Irrlicht rendering engine when I tried it some years ago, because it was very
		concise and tidy. IrrKlang is very easy to get running - much tidier than
		OpenAL, and much less bloated than FMod Ex. Time-to-sound-played is about 1
		minute. Hard to beat! Unfortunately it's C++ though, not C, so I had to change
		my compiler. I can say that I like it and would probably use it again.
	</p>

	<iframe width="420" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/BAXnBuPx6uM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

	<p>
		I have 3 sounds - an engine loop, a crash event sound, and a music track.
		Rather than use something like the original, I hunted for a 'period piece' of
		1987 cheesy underground techno. I found one called "Amama" by a group called
		"Pink Project" from 1982. Perfect! I didn't put the track in the version that I
		uploaded, just in case!
	</p>

	<h2>Finishing Screen and Text Rendering</h2>

	<p>
		My final addition was a suitably awful-looking victory screen that prints your
		finishing time and number of crashes over it. I found a suitable picture of a
		Countach on some cliffs and "coloured it in".
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/tdrive_end.png" /><br />
		<p><small>
				The stylish victory screen with text rendering.
			</small></p>
	</div>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/tdrive_font.png" /><br />
		<p><small>
				The font atlas. I pre-calculate the texture-coordinates to use for each
				character in a string of text and generate geometry for each.
			</small></p>
	</div>

	<p>
		The text is from a simple drop-in library that I made for OpenGL, to make
		student assignments a bit easier. You can find that on GitHub:
		<a
			href="https://github.com/capnramses/opengl_text_rendering">https://github.com/capnramses/opengl_text_rendering</a>.
		It uses a bitmap atlas that I generated (with yet another tool that I put on
		GitHub) of a free font. This also provided a text file of the size of each
		glyph. I have a little function in my drop-in code that maps strings of text
		into the appropriate texture coordinates within the atlas. A rather brutish
		approach takes the size of each glyph and generates triangles big enough to
		fit it. Alpha blending is used to make the background transparent so that the
		text can overlay the background.
	</p>

	<h2>Debugging and Optimisation</h2>

	<p>
		I have a debug mode that I can compile to with the <tt>-DDEBUG</tt> flag. This
		prints a frame counter and various draw and update counts over the display.
	</p>

	<p>
		I added a simple "don't render anything behind the camera" test to keep the
		number of draw calls to a safe minimum. I also added a maximum draw distance
		check before drawing anything. I wanted to demo simple hierarchical animation,
		so my trucks actually use 5 draw calls, when they should really only need 1.
	</p>

	<p>
		My textures and shaders were all pretty trivial, and I didn't have many
		uniforms abusing the bus because of my attribute-less rendering. I limited the
		speed of text updates to about 0.1 seconds, as these do generate new triangles
		every time that the text changes.
	</p>

	<p>
		I could have added-in uniform buffer objects to share my camera matrices around
		all of the shaders - it would have been a good case for this as I was
		deliberately using OpenGL 4.2 and had several shaders. I wanted to keep
		everything easy to read for initiates though.
	</p>

	<h2>Structure, Total Time, Review</h2>

	<p>
		I spent about 5 evenings on this - about 15-20 hours in total including Twitter
		distraction nonsense. The design was basically just a road generated in a loop,
		and the rest was just plugging extra features on until I ran out of time.
	</p>

	<p>
		I <u>drew</u> my algorithm for generating the road terrain before I coded it -
		this saved me a lot of time.
	</p>

	<h3>Style / Structure / Speed</h3>

	<p>
		I wrote the whole thing in plain C, but used a C++ compiler so that I could try
		the IrrKlang audio library. Each module of my programme is a separate C file.
		There are no classes, object orientated things, templates, inheritance, few
		comments, little-to-no code re-use, and long functions are the rule. I only
		use a loop if I copy-paste code <u>more than 3 times</u>. There's not a
		single design pattern anywhere. I barely did any validation. Errors are not
		try-catch clauses - they just dump to terminal with an <tt>assert()</tt> at
		most. I don't ever do any re-factoring - I write it in a simple style the
		first time around. I wrote most of my code in plain text editors - I don't care
		which one - but <tt>nano</tt> on the BASh terminal, <tt>gedit</tt>,
		and Wordpad on Windows are my most
		commonly used ones, because they have very little extra-fluff - if you're goofing
		around with "productivity enhancing" plug-ins you're wasting your time. These
		things usually take more time to install and load than any time they potentially
		save. I don't
		need syntax highlighting, and would rather read a man-page and actually understand a
		function that I don't know than use some unintelli-lookup rubbish. I
		don't use an IDE unless it's to keep someone else happy - Unix Makefiles are much
		quicker and easier to fix. I work on 4 different machines, and 3 different
		operating systems, and
		it was really easy to just copy-paste my Makefile and tweak to get it running
		on different platforms. I don't use any meta-build generator tools - that's
		just more software engineering complexity that makes a big mess. I very seldom
		need to debug anything - I feel like needing to debug is a personal failure to
		understand
		my own logic - I prefer to re-read my code to understand. When I do debug,
		I use command-line
		tools like <tt>gdb</tt> - a back-trace is usually all I need to find a bad
		memory access or broken library. I think using an IDE with easy-to-use
		breakpoints can quickly train you to rely on them and adds further passes
		over your code as part of your routine. I barely ever do any C-side
		profiling. Most of the actual debug and profiling tasks are for the GPU, and I
		use a mixed-arms approach to narrow-down these issues - a variety of simple
		tools and techniques to visualise problems with colours.
	</p>

	<p>
		I know people that are religiously fanatical about OO design and software
		engineering, and think I'm some
		sort of horrible heretic to even entertain this notion, but not bothering with
		any software engineering "musts" meant that I can
		code graphics <b>extremely</b> quickly. While they're carefully encapsulating
		their classes and making an architecture of generic objects I'm already
		rendering my final screen.
	</p>


	<h3>Anton's Speed Coding Secrets</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>don't do OO, refactoring, inheritance, classes, etc.</li>
		<li>write long functions</li>
		<li>don't screw around with IDEs and fancy tools - plain text</li>
		<li>dope self with coffee</li>
		<li>evil heavy metal playlist [headphones]</li>
		<li>work late at night - no distractions, tired brain is noise free</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		My upstairs neighbour actually made a formal complaint to the building manager
		about my coding playlist while I was working on this so now [headphones] is on there.
	</p>

	<p>
		I doubt there's many people that
		code OpenGL faster than me [gauntlet laid down] - although a few of my
		students most definitely got more done in a shorter period of weeks!
	</p>

	<h2>Things That I Left Out</h2>

	<p>
		I didn't do the Police-car mechanism! I left this out of my plans because I
		knew it would be a bit too involved, and take too long. I wanted to finish
		before the student assignments were due. In the original you had a Police radio
		detector on the dashboard, and if driving too fast could be pulled over by the
		police and given a ticket!
	</p>

	<p>
		I didn't add any other types of car traffic - I got a bit attached to the
		trucks.
	</p>

	<p>
		I didn't add any more levels, because basically the original game was only one
		course that repeated. I just made my one-level game randomly generated instead.
	</p>

	<p>
		The original game had shoulder lanes and hills. Hills might have been more
		interesting for driving on, although would have required some further
		complexity. It might have been cool to add tunnels or something.
	</p>
