	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>Playing with Things</h2>

	<h3>Colours and Gamma Correction</h3>

	<p>
		I got sick of loading up GIMP to pick a nice colour for shaders, and then
		converting from 0-255 into 0.0-1.0 so <a href="https://antongerdelan.net/colour/">
			I made a colour chooser</a> using WebGL. I
		copied GIMP's HSV (Hue/Saturation/Value) widget, which looks pretty much the
		same as Photoshop's. This meant learning a bit about colour space
		representations but it wasn't too tricky.
	</p>

	<p>
		I've been curious about gamma correction lately, so I thought it would be neat
		to add an option to set a gamma value that should apply a correction to all the
		colour space boxes in view e.g. a preview what the colour values should look
		like if a gamma of 2.2 were applied afterwards.
	</p>

	<h3>Three.js</h3>

	<p>
		I had a play with the Three.js framework for WebGL. My hunch was that if I built
		webgl software on top of Three.js then it would be easier for non-graphics
		experts to add to it later. So far I've been reading through Tony Parisi's book
		on WebGL, which is very simplistic. Both the framework and the book target the
		web developer crowd I think, as it relies heavily on JavaScript OO ideas, but
		hides almost all the OpenGL-style interface and does not require strong working
		knowledge of maths or graphics theory. There is a certain appeal to this because
		it opens up 3d graphics to a whole new group of people. It's worth noting that
		Eric Haines' online course also uses Three.js, which is a very safe way to avoid
		getting mired with all the inevitable low-level GL API problems which would
		otherwise take up the vast majority of learning time.
	</p>

	<a href="https://antongerdelan.net/demos/threejs_01">WebGL Up and Running Exercise 2</a>

	<p>
		I found a couple of things surprising, going through the book. Firstly, it is
		taking just as long to learn Three.js and go through the examples as it did to
		go through the core WebGL interface with Cantor/Jones' "Beginner's Guide" book.
		Secondly, it's not easy to debug the "nothing is showing on the screen" errors
		with
		Three.js. I expected some sort of idiot-proof validation or error throwing, but
		nope - traditional black screen. So far I get the impression that it's really just a wrapper
		that presents a web-developer style interface in place of the native
		C-style interface. Certainly OpenGL-style interfaces are absolutely terrifying
		for most modern web and object-oriented programmers, so maybe that's a big
		advantage. Even the colours expect
		HTML-style hex instead of floating point. There are default shaders, which means
		that it looks like you can render stuff without writing a shader. So far I have
		a feeling that a lot of stuff is unnecessarily hidden behind
		HTML/CSS/JS cruft layers. It's not clear what's happening behind
		the scenes a lot of the time. Advocates of top-down or high-level programming
		would say this is the right way to go. Is this the right way to go - I'm not
		sure yet, but I'll keep going for now.
	</p>

	<h3>Archicture</h3>

	<p>
		I've been playing with AchiCAD, AutoCAD, and Revit, and building renderers for
		building models. I'll write another post on this when I get some time.
	</p>

	<h3>Books</h3>

	<p>
		I'm reading Kerninghan and Ritchie's "The C Programming Language" - I had never
		read the original. The first edition was also the C Language specification
		before ANSI C was formed. This second edition is the semi-official programmers
		reference. I'm interested both from a teaching viewpoint as well as seeing if I
		can pick up a few tricks that I've missed. I'm not sure that I like it - it
		reads like an average 101 programming course, but it's very dull, and not
		entirely clear. As a reference, I actually found some of the pocket-sized C
		books better and easier to read, but these are often lambasted by C aficionados,
		who you'll see have entire websites criticising them that are almost as long as
		the books themselves... I note that Ritchie himself is guilty of many of the
		unforgivable crimes that are enumerated by critics of other books. Programmers
		go a bit funny over languages. I'll write a review when/if I make it to the end.
	</p>

	<h3>OpenCV</h3>

	<p>
		I got sick of crappy webcam software for Ubuntu. Cheese has a nasty habit of
		crashing the entire system after it takes a photo, and Camorama doesn't give
		you a delay. So...I made my own using OpenCV. One version records a
		high-resolution video using a nanosecond precision timer (OpenCV's own timer is
		bad - it's based on the inconsistent C timers), and another one gives you a 5
		second countdown before taking a picture...and then loops again and again so
		that if you screw it up slightly you don't have to go over to the computer to
		make another attempt. In other words you can bust out pose after pose after
		pose! The video recorder version was for rotoscoping animation
		work - you can specify the time between frames to match up with the intended
		animation frames.
