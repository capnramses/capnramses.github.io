	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>Static Code Analysis</h2>

	<p>
		Today I used a
		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis">static analysis</a>
		tool on some of my source code, and gave it a good, thorough run through. I'd
		never really done this before. I used "cppcheck" on my C source code. You just
		invoke it on your source folder with some optional flags - all very simple.
		Summary:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Trivial to use</li>
		<li>Catches lots of bugs that compilers don't</li>
		<li>Can hint about where to improve performance or portability</li>
		<li>Names unused functions and variables that you can delete</li>
		<li>No mess, no fuss - gives you the specific source file and line number</li>
		<li>Worth it</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		It immediately found 2 invalid array accesses, and told me about an invalid
		pointer assignment, that I was relying on working later in my code.
	</p>

	<p>
		You can also go into verbose mode and get a whole list of potential problems,
		or style warnings - every time you use <tt>fscanf</tt> for a string parsing
		operation it warns you that it's unsafe, for example. I can see how you might
		use this occasionally during development to help write better code as you go,
		by always aiming for a "no warnings" output or so. I was pleasantly surprised
		that my code was pretty water-tight. The couple of problems it found were very
		worth finding, as it would have been a real pain to track them down after a
		segfault later.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are other programmes that might be more comprehensive, but most are
		commercial or IDE-tied. For C code (not C++) there is a free programme called
		"splint". I found that it gets caught up on library includes quite easily,
		which makes it less practical to use but perhaps there is an option to ignore
		certain includes.
