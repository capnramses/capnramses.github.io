	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>Graphics and Game Industry Acronyms</h2>

	<p>
		I despise acronyms. They are a lazy crutch to hide poor command of language and
		weak vocabularies. Proper English uses abbreviations instead (I'm also quite
		fond of German abbreviated compounds). Unless you have one of those wholly
		in-efficient brains that remembers everything in detail, acronyms are also
		very, very difficult to remember - especially so when they start to double-up.
		The worst thing is in-crowd people in technology who talk entirely in acronyms,
		and follow up with condescension if, heaven forbid, you don't know one. I'm just
		going to collect a huge list of technical nonsense terms here relating to
		graphics programming, graphics hardware, and also from the game industry that
		pop up in the same sentences. I'll keep building on to this post in the future.
