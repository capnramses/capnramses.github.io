	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>Mesa3D</h2>

	<p>
		I'm absolutely ruined from the weekend/last week's training and having a very
		early Sunday night, so jotting some notes while I'm having a rare quiet moment.
		I got a refurbished Lenovo laptop for doing slides and a bit of away-from-desk
		work because my previous laptop met with an unfortunate accident. It doesn't
		have a graphics chip, of course, but I thought I'd take a look at the
		<a href="http://www.mesa3d.org/â€Ž">mesa3d</a> project. This is an open-source
		implementation of OpenGL, which provides up to OpenGL 3.1 support, and also
		does software emulation.
	</p>

	<p>
		I took my OpenGL 4 "Hello Triangle" demo, and built
		that with some locally compiled GLFW and GLEW libraries. If I leave out the
		hint to GLFW to which version it should use, it reports "OpenGL 2.1". If I
		explicitly say "use 3.1" it crashes - I guess the software emulation doesn't
		extend that far. Using the default 2.1, it does open an OpenGL window, and
		clears the screen with no errors, but it doesn't show my triangle. The shaders
		needed a few minor changes to back-port to the GLSL version used by OpenGL 2.1.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><tt>#version 420</tt> &rarr; <tt>#version 120</tt></li>
		<li>delete <tt>out vec4 frag_colour</tt>, use built-in <tt>gl_FragColor</tt></li>
		<li>rename <tt>in</tt> keyword in vertex shader to <tt>attribute</tt></li>
		<li>if I had an out/in from vertex shader to fragment shader, these both become
			<tt>varying</tt></li>
	</ul>

		And it works. These are pretty much the same shaders as are used in the current
		generation of WebGL, and OpenGL ES 1 and 2. Haven't looked at 3 yet.
		Interestingly, the per-pixel shading works on a computer with no graphics
		adaptor (I think), which I guess is mesa doing a fine job of emulating things.
		I wasn't able to do anything with shaders on previous PCs, even though they
		had early Nvidia adapters. I just checked, and I can also run
		<a href="https://antongerdelan.net/dolphin_rescue/">https://antongerdelan.net/dolphin_rescue/</a>
		on this laptop, which is all shader-based. Interesting. I probably would have
		gotten away with making my full-on OpenGL game in OpenGL 2.1 - none of the
		advanced shader techniques are at all reliable anyway, but it's probably a lot
		of hassle for little return at this stage. I have no idea if Windows would
		then require a mesa build - I guess so, as the built-in stuff is still MS'
		horrible OpenGL 1.1 implementation, if I recall correctly.
	</p>

	<p>
		So Mesa is really very good these days. I haven't speed tested it, but I
		wouldn't doubt that I could run my game on it. It looks like it's still
		GNU/Linux focused, but does a good job of running OpenGL 2.1 with shaders.
	</p>

	<h2>Some Things to Try This Week</h2>

	<p>
		I've been taking advantage of a quiet period at work to reformat my tutorials
		for Kindle, and revising tutorials as I go. It's a long, long slow process. I
		am also building a collection of stand-alone demos - one for each tutorial.
		I've nearly nearly finished them. I want to add some extra material for the
		e-book that I don't have in the tutorial series - related topics and opinion
		pieces/suggestions. I have a few neat tricks that didn't really fit quite well
		into the tutorial series, but are still useful as appendix stuff I think;
		code structure, handling meshes/buffers/arrays, some optimisations, etc.
		Things to try this week:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>OS-detecting GNU Makefiles for OpenGL demos</li>
		<li>Uniform Buffer Objects</li>
		<li>Writing/reading a simplified, binary version of my custom mesh format</li>
		<li>Upgrading my Android port of our WebGL simulation</li>
		<li>Try some simple Arduino projects</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		I got into Android NDK programming last year, and I never really finished off
		the little 3d demo that I made. The Android development kit is the most
		over-complicated horrible programming that I've ever done. Java is just a
		disgusting waste of time, so I used the NDK ("native" development kit) instead,
		which gives you a way to write more efficient code for things like OpenGL ES,
		which I wanted to do. The whole kit of tools and things for Android is
		absolutely horrific, and I really don't enjoy using it at all. Apple has a much
		more pleasant kit. The main problem is that you can't just load a file, or use
		<tt>printf</tt>...or compile locally on the machine...or ssh to the machine...
		or do anything really outside of the custom framework. It took me a week of
		hair-pulling to redirect <tt>printf</tt> to the custom Android log manager, and
		hook up the asset manager so that I could parse plain ASCII files from C. All
		the files in your app .apk get compressed, so you either have to hand-write a
		decompressor with <tt>libz</tt>, or use the built-in Asset Manager, which is
		Java only. To do this you use a C-Java binding called "JNI", which stands for
		"an abomination that crawled out of the Pit". Once you finally get all this set
		up you are okay and can code into OpenGL ES. I couldn't get C++ working nicely
		so I just ported my maths library to C'89, which was kind of cleaner than the
		C++ version. The disappointing thing is that you still need to use a mixed bag
		of semi-broken custom Android tools - and at least occasionally use Eclipse and
		Java (burrrgh).
	</p>

	<p>
		I ordered a whole bunch of Arduino stuff a couple of months ago. Hopefully that
		will actually arrive this week, and I can get into some micro-controller
		programming.
