	<h2>WebGL Talk for Internet Society</h2>

	<p>
		I did a talk this wednesday night (18th Feb 2015) for the <a href="https://www.netsoc.tcd.ie/">Dublin University
			Internet Society</a> - "netsoc". You can find my slides
		<a href="../teaching/guest_lectures/2015_02_18_netsoc/2015_02_18_webgl_netsoc.pdf">here</a>.
		The idea was to do an introduction to WebGL for students that have a strong web and
		Internet background, but not necessarily graphics programming experience.
		My main theme or point was to contrast why previous attempts at on-line 3d
		didn't really take off against some of the advantages of webgl. I also had a
		little code example of getting started.
	</p>

	<h2>Blog Changes</h2>

	<p>
		I renamed all my blog posts so that they have a subject in the index, as well
		as the date. This will break all of the hard-links to posts as the URL for
		each has changed now accordingly. That's probably not soooo bad as most of the
		posts people link to here are my more controversial opinions that ruffle the
		feathers of tech groups.
