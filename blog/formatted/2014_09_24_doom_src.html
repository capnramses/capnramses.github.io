	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>Original DOOM Source Code</h2>

	<p>
		I've been having a look at the original DOOM source code, which id Software has
		put on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM">https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM</a>.
		I wanted to see if I could follow their source code, and maybe find something neat for my bag of tricks.
	</p>

	<p>
		I ended up succesfully porting the video output to a modern platform-independent OS window on 64-bit
		machines too!
	</p>

	<h3>Code Style Review</h3>

	<p>
		The first thing that strikes me is that it's in C, not C++, and actually the style and conventions are
		almost exactly the same as those I've grown to prefer myself. They use C++ comments, with some blank
		comment lines to emphasise headings for functions and things:
	</p>

	<textarea rows=8>
//
// This is how a function is described
// some more details
//
void actual_function () {
  // a commented line in a function
  int the_thing;
}</textarea>

	<p>
		Otherwise it's pretty much GNU-standard style, which I think I saw John Carmack support in a tweet
		somewhere. They even have GNU-standard Changelogs and Makefiles. The indentation is a bit messy - tabs are
		always assumed to be equivalent to 8 spaces or something crap like that. I guess that's the default in
		emacs or whatever they were using.
	</p>

	<p>
		The <b>really</b> nice thing about this code is that it's bare-bones C. It has basically no external
		dependencies on dated DOS libraries that are gone. If you want to write code that lasts <b>do re-invent the
			wheel</b>, <b>do not re-use code from others</b>. There are some supporting utility functions however,
		but that's all plain C and included in the source. Notable missing external libraries used, which are
		absent for copyright reasons (Carmack notes in the README that he regrets using these):
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Sound and music playback.</li>
		<li>Video display (DOS and presumably the original Unix-based NeXT-Step one).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		They've replaced these in the '90s with a woefully out-of date X server for linux, and woefully out-of-date
		inadequate Linux sound system, neither of which will run on a modern system.
	</p>

	<p>
		It's hard-coded to use 32-bit computing, and uses a lot of integer-pointer arithmetic. The problem with this
		is that on a modern, 64-bit computer, it won't compile because the size of integers is still 32-bits but
		the size of pointers has doubled to 64-bits. 64-bit pointers let us do wonderful things like address more than 4GB
		of memory. The compiler is disgusted by any such 32-64 number comparisons. Integer/pointer comparisons are
		not a great idea anyway, and these days we have some data types to abstract these problems.
	</p>

	<p>
		There were a few bugs in the source which look like were errors introduced post-release to cope with the
		third-party add-on episodes. The compiler found these, and it was easy to fix them. Mostly just a case of
		strings for map names being longer than the allocated memory for the string. An incorrect system header for
		error numbers was used - I just renamed that.
	</p>

	<p>
		There are little scraps of assembler code inlined, which is pretty neat, and these seem to play well with
		a GCC compile.
	</p>

	<p>
		One neat trick that I found was a nice way to check all the command-line parameters for a particular
		phrase. I always did this the hard way in a big nest of if-else clauses:
	</p>

	<textarea rows=18>
//
// M_CheckParm
// Checks for the given parameter
// in the program's command line arguments.
// Returns the argument number (1 to argc-1)
// or 0 if not present
int M_CheckParm (char *check)
{
    int		i;

    for (i = 1;i<myargc;i++)
    {
	if ( !strcasecmp(check, myargv[i]) )
	    return i;
    }

    return 0;
}</textarea>

	<p>
		Another neat trick that I somehow missed thus-far is that in a Makefile you can flag-in some
		#defines that affect your code! It's just a <tt>-D</tt> flag, so you can do stuff like
		<tt>-Danton</tt>, and then in your code put some <tt>#ifdef ANTON</tt> to get a special build.
	</p>

	<h3>Compiling</h3>

	<p>
		The README says that it can only run now on Linux. Actually that's not true;
		it won't run on anything, but it will eventually compile on Linux. There was
		probably a period of time for about 1 year after source release where a display
		driver for a large, beige-coloured CRT would accept a resolution ratio of
		320x200 at 35Hz. The main problem
		now though is actually the older 32-bit hard-coded stuff. I didn't
		want to tediously fix all the 32-bit pointer arithmetic, so I just modified the
		Makefile to use 32-bit libraries and compile for 32-bit. It didn't work - I was
		missing a whole lot of 32-bit libraries on my 64-bit Xubuntu machine.
	</p>

	<p>
		After updating my 32-bit development libraries it actually compiled! Imagine my
		elation. Now, the video code that they'd Frankensteined onto the end expected
		you to run a 320x200 full-screen 8-bit X display at 35Hz.
		I thought, "Hey, why not try it - for science?", even though I knew my video resolution
		supported a full-screen minimum of 640x480, and even scaling-up 320x200 a couple of times
		probably wouldn't work (wrong aspect ratio). It was a bad idea - I broke my video config
		and couldn't boot back in to my user account until I wiped all my video config manually
		from another super-user terminal, and fiddled with the incorrectly re-generating .Xauthority.
		Damnit linux! <b>End of first evening</b>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Not to be beaten, I was convinced that this old DOS display stuff must be pretty easy
		underneath the hood. It must be raster graphics. It must write directly to pixels in a big
		320x200 array of bytes. This must get copied entire-frame-by-entire-frame to the display
		interface by the game. My first step was to try to surgically remove all of the X-display
		interface and get it to compile and run without any graphics - just on a terminal. The nice
		thing about id's code style is that it's arranged the same as mine - one code module per .c
		file. I quickly fgrepped and found it was all in <tt>i_video.c</tt> (presumably 'i' for interface).
		It also had a whack of crappy X-server keyboard event code there too. And some horrible hacky
		"add a mouse cursor but make it invisible and also make sure it stays inside the boundaries of
		the 'window' so the programme doesn't lose focus on the OS". What a load of horrible linux
		crapware (I can't stand the X+distribution window layers on top of GNU/Linux - unreliable shite).
		I knew what I had to do at this point. I commented out all the X interface code (easily spotted) and
		headers. I commented out all the user input too (also X event stuff). And guess what - it worked!
	</p>

	<p>
		So I had Doom's demo loop running in a terminal window, with the familiar load-up printfs, and some
		error messages every few frames complaining that my WAD was a different version to the source code.
		Encouraging! Now, could I fiddle around with graphics and get <b>anything</b> to write to a pixel or
		two? My general plan forming at this stage was to use a platform-independent windowing library to let me
		draw to a window instead of fullscreen. This would:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Avoid the problems with the dead-and-gone 4:2.5 aspect ratio</li>
		<li>Avoid the problems with the dead-and-gone 35Hz display frequency</li>
		<li>Run on ANY modern desktop (Windows/Linux/Apple)</li>
		<li>Let me hook-in OpenGL to use for basic rendering, with the advantages of
			built-in texture scaling (to 1600x1000px for example), anti-aliasing if desired.</li>
		<li>Still leave all the original source code un-modified (expect for the bug fixes).</li>
		<li>Also provide better keyboard input handling in a platform-independent way.</li>
		<li>Be easy to extend for more advanced graphics programming/opengl mod projects.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		I kind-of liked some of the modern Doom ports which also add fancy lighting and transparent stuff and
		even 3d models, but it's not the same as having the original code, and even the original pixelated graphics!
		So I wanted to keep it as pure as possible, but get some sort of display out. I didn't feel bad about
		trashing the X interface stuff, because that wasn't in the original anyway. Also, if I was to change some
		stuff like game code (weapon damage, AI?) then I wanted to see if I could improve the original, not modify
		someone else's replacement code.
	</p>

	<h3>Writing a New Display Interface</h3>

	<p>
		I quickly found the 320x200 array I was looking for being passed to X - a buffer called <tt>image.data</tt>
		in bytes. It looked promising. I knew I could make OpenGL expect an 8-bit RGB source image, so my plan,
		as it stood, was to copy this into a texture, and throw this onto a full-screen quad with some simple
		nearest-neighbour image sampling. I went hunting for all the DOOM code that copied bytes into this buffer,
		and put my own buffer there instead.
	</p>

	<p>
		I pulled out my 32-bit linux laptop and made sure I had a 32-bit libGL.so (I later found I had this on my
		64-bit machine too, but oh well). I successfully started up GLFW and GLEW, and got a system window at
		320x200px with a viewport the same size (it's tiny now). I got something! I got noise in my image! Okay,
		so maybe this was going to be too hard, maybe not - but....but I found I was missing a few data copies, and
		fixed that. This is what I got:
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/doomhack0.png" /><br />
		<p><small>
				It's upside-down. It has crap in it. It's repeated 3 times. The colours are wrong. But it <b>clearly says
					"DOOM"</b>. I knew I was in business at this point.
			</small></p>
	</div>

	<p>
		I actually expected it to be-upside down, and this was easily fixed by inverting the T-axis in my vertex
		shader where I derive my texture-coordinates per-vertex. The noise and tripling I figured was probably a
		mis-match between amount of data expected and amount of data actually in the image buffer. Thinking about
		it the buffer had 320x200 bytes in it, but I was expecting 320x200x3 (x1 byte each for red, blue, and green
		channels for each pixel). I hoped that there wasn't some special format for colour values, or some special
		bit-encoded custom format for each pixel. This didn't sound right though - less than 256 colours per pixel
		wouldn't be enough for DOOM's quite rich colours. It had to something to do with the palette system that
		Carmack mentioned in the README as an expected difficulty. Anyway, keeping this on the back-burner I flipped
		the display and added keyboard controls for ESCAPE, ENTER and UPARROW. I got what I had hoped for:
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/doomhack1.png" /><br />
		<p><small>
				The ESCAPE and ENTER buttons let me bring up the menu (phew, it worked!), and start E1M1. When UPARROW let
				me actually move in 3d I knew I was about to crack the whole thing. The game loop and movement motion
				worked perfectly!
			</small></p>
	</div>

	<p>
		I saw an article <a href="http://zdoom.org/wiki/palette">here</a> about the colour palettes used in different games
		based on the Doom engine. It
		looks like they used a single look-up table which could be replaced for different game art styles. They
		could even change the palette in-game to have special effects like whole-screen flashes or whole-screen
		red when the player is hurt. Neat. This had to be what I was assuming was the final image - the 320x200
		bytes buffer. Each value wasn't a colour at all, but an arbitrary combination of colours. This meant that
		there was a look-up table in the main code somewhere which would set the red, blue, and green values of
		each palette index. I dug around (well, fgrepped) until I found it. And there it was - exactly what I
		needed for my image. I just reversed this palette-encoding function to "correct" my image buffer from
		320x200 palette indices to 320x200x3 RGB values, 8-bits per channel. I figured X must have already been
		asking for this, but nope, their display function was taking the palette as a function parameter to the X
		display function (what the hell X, what kind of weirdo 1980s display are you?).
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/doomhack2.png" /><br />
		<p><small>
				ULTIMATE VICTORY! I never thought I would get this far with such old code, written by other people.
				I scaled up to 640x400. Because I'm sampling a texture I can resize my viewport to any dimensions and it
				will work - I'll try to keep to factors of 320x200 though.
			</small></p>
	</div>

	<p>
		So, I tested it, and it runs on my 32-bit and 64-bit machines, and I know I can easily compile the same
		code on Windows 32 and 64-bit now too! Apple should work, as long as it doesn't mind compiling in 32-bit
		mode on the newer 64-bit machines. I don't fancy fixing all the pointers (there are hundreds and hundreds).
	</p>

	<p>
		I got a lot more of the keyboard keys working, although my code is a bit messy. It also runs Doom II!
		I can turn on anti-aliasing to fix most of the original pixellation-due-to-scaling issues in a nice way,
		but leaving the filters in <tt>GL_NEAREST</tt> feels right for now.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/doomhack3.png" /><br />
		<p><small>
				IDBEHOLD the aliasing!
			</small></p>
	</div>

	<p>
		The entire process took 2 evenings of my gamedev time. Always worth it challenging yourself to new things!
		I'll tidy it up, add the rest of the keyboard controls, and post the code somewhere. There are loads of
		great Doom ports, but I think this might be the most minimal whilst reliably working. Stuff I didn't do:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Finish the keyboard controls</li>
		<li>Recreate the sound system in a multi-platform way (OpenAL might be okay - FMOD or IrrKlang better)</li>
		<li>Improve the efficiency of frame-drawing (who cares, it only has to run at 35Hz)</li>
		<li>Fix a couple of crash-bugs in the original source (one of the "are you sure you want to quit?" messages
			is stack smashing) - there are some pretty naughty hidden quit messages in there btw.</li>
		<li>Fiddle with the original code - weapons, baddies, etc.</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Met John and Brenda Romero</h2>

	<p>
		On a related note, I also met Brenda and John Romero after a talk at DIT in Dublin, and got John to sign
		my Doom poster! Chatted about Dangerous Dave.
