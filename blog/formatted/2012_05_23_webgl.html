	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2 id="23may2012">23 May 2012.</h2>
	<h3>The Demo Was Easy</h3>

	<p class="small">
		Yesterday, I had a play with the intro code on <a href="http://learningwebgl.com/">http://learningwebgl.com/</a>.
		I made this: <i>(click image to run)</i>.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<a href="https://antongerdelan.net/demos/helloworld/less1.html">
			<img src="https://antongerdelan.net/demos/helloworld/shot1.png" width="512" />
		</a><br />
		<small><i>Pgup, Pgdn to control. No sweat - it took 30mins to get this running from scratch.</i></small>
	</div>

	<p class="small">
		Pgup/pgdn turns out to be not the best
		keys to use in a browser for interacting with the thing.
		Some things were surprising:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>I heard that WebGL <b>uses</b> HTML5</i>. Reality: just write 1 pair of <tt>canvas</tt> tags.</li>
		<li><i>Javascript will take ages to learn</i>. Reality: it's just a slack version of C.</li>
		<li><i>It will be too slow</i>. Wasn't.</i>
		<li>The structure of a Javascript GL programme is almost identical to a C GL programme using GLUT.</li>
		<li>Keyboard input was even easier to get working than with GLUT.</li>
		<li>It's much faster to write programmes with WebGL because you don't need to waste all that time linking and
			re-compiling</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>I have a few concerns</h3>
	<p class="small">
		Firstly, <b>loading meshes and texture data</b> looks like it could be problematic and/or slow. Many mesh-loader
		demos don't work properly. Most wrappers seem to load Wavefront (.obj format) data but then convert it to JSON using
		a Python script
		before reading into Javascript.
	</p>
	<p class="small">
		Secondly, I doubt that Javascript, which is interpreted, can handle any real <b>simulation processing</b>. Perhaps
		threads are feasible.
		In this case, it might be necessary to use WebGL as a client-side <b>rendering service</b> only (which is okay),
		but still use a server-based or locally compiled simulation for doing any grunt work. There is still the problem
		of sending large chunks of texture and geometry data to the client and/or updating the data regularly, so there is
		a new bus/pipe that could be a weak link in a real-time rendering chain. This might even be an ideal arrangement
		for large scientific or medical simulation; terminals with a GPU connected to a big processing farm, but is it
		reasonable to do this for games and entertainment? Certainly, it would be great for platform-independence of
		software. <a href="http://media.tojicode.com/q3bsp/">This</a> Quake 3 demo works (and fast), but nothing happens
		on the CPU - it's just a level viewer really. But then this is good: <a
			href="http://playwebgl.com/games/quake-2-webgl/">http://playwebgl.com/games/quake-2-webgl/</a>.
	</p>
	<p class="small">
		Thirdly, I don't know how <b>debugging and profiling</b> will work with Javascript. I have been profiling my C
		OpenGL programmes
		and discovered that a huge amount of time is sucked up when uniform variables are frequently sent to the GPU. I've
		redesigned my programmes to only send uniform updates when a value has actually changed. All the WebGL samples
		that I've seen so far have got this completely backwards. This could be because it's still web-developer hobbyists
		making most of the demos, or because not a lot of processing is done in Javascript compared to their shader
		programmes,
		but I suspect it might be that the profiling tools aren't great or just aren't as readily accessible as people
		prefer to
		code JS in a text editor. Will try.
	</p>

	<h3>Next Steps</h3>
	<p class="small">
		Some of the <a href="http://weblog.benjaminsommer.com/blog/2012/05/13/comparison-of-webgl-framework-apis/">
			recent criticisms</a> of the most popular WebGL wrappers is that they either don't have a proper shader class, or
		that you are forced
		to use the same set of per-vertex attributes for every renderable - more like the last decade's computer graphics.
		So it looks like a good start will be:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Write a shader class .js file that I can include. It should replicate all of the functionality of my
			<a href="https://antongerdelan.net/opengl/index.php?title=Shaders">C version</a>.</li>
		<li>Write a renderable class .js file that can load different options from a script (same as my OpenGL version).
		</li>
	</ul>
