	<h2>Custom Animated Mesh Format</h2>

	<p>
		Parsing an animated mesh to use in a graphics programme is far more complex
		than it need be. If you're in a large team, for example on a computer game
		project, you'll likely have one or more <b>technical artists</b>, who will be
		responsible for handling this area in-between the different 3d modelling
		and end-product software. They'll more than likely decide on a mesh file format,
		and write plug-in scripts in Python to handle import and export for all the
		different software tools. That's all good and well, but what if you just want
		to try something out in a little demo, or are working by yourself? Should you
		really have to learn the Blender Python API? Can't you just use one of the
		existing file formats?
	</p>

	<h3>Why Existing Animated Mesh Formats All Suck</h3>

	<p>
		Writing shaders to do skinning, and a recursive function to animate a mesh
		isn't that hard if you've got a grasp of matrix transformation. Making an
		animated mesh in modelling software isn't all that difficult either, once
		you've got the hang of the user interfaces. The actual input data that you
		need is fairly simple, and if you structure your code cleanly, will just go
		into a few simple arrays. Why are all of the available mesh file formats so
		ridiculously over-complicated then? Why can't they just be plain text that can
		be readily parsed with <tt>fscanf()</tt>? Some of the transgressions of common
		animated formats include:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>ambiguous specifications</li>
		<li>nested nests of trees of nested trees</li>
		<li>bizarre and ambiguous naming conventions</li>
		<li>gluts of extra-fluff, cameras, lights, and useless meta-data</li>
		<li>strings as identifiers</li>
		<li>support for graphics library components that don't exist any more</li>
		<li>lack of support for modern graphics library components</li>
		<li>whole trees just to map other trees to other trees</li>
		<li>identifiers for elements at different levels of trees to where the data reside</li>
		<li>optional attributes that are actually required and meaningful</li>
		<li>element names that are reused for different types of data</li>
		<li>unnecessary indentations and white-space</li>
		<li>poorly implemented rotations and interpolations</li>
		<li>indexed lists of things mean assembly and memory juggling is required after parsing</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The short story is that you don't want to deal with parsing any of these
		abominations directly. Parsing an ambiguous format like COLLADA is not worth
		your effort - you'll get it to work for Blender's export script, and it won't
		support one from another modeller. A similar problem exists for Autodesk's .fbx
		because of the multitude of different, and incompatible, versions in play. XML
		files are not nice to parse in C, and aside from wasting time traversing trees
		and string-based keys, they typically require a parsing library, and require
		an enormous amount of validation code to guard against pointer errors - every
		time that you fetch a new element. The non-XML formats in trees are even worse,
		because you'll need to write custom tree-parsing code too. There are other,
		simpler, formats around like Id's .md5, but good luck finding a reliable set of
		exporters and importers!
	</p>

	<h3>Assimp</h3>

	<p>
		The Open Asset Import Library; "Assimp"
		(<a href="http://assimp.sourceforge.net/">http://assimp.sourceforge.net/</a>)
		offers a beacon of hope, because it does all of the dirty work of parsing
		various versions of various different mesh formats, and represents their
		contents with a single interface. It has bindings for various languages. I
		made a tutorial that used Assimp to do animation directly in OpenGL, but
		basically everyone that's used it got stuck on the Assimp part. Assimp is very
		painful to build locally, has a very big compiled size to link against, meaning
		that it will slow down your compile times. It doesn't seem to build well to
		deploy on different systems (different Mac OS versions were not happy), and the
		interface is incredibly confusing and not at all efficient for run-time use.
		So it's not really great as an end-use tool in your graphics programme. What it
		is very good for, however, is building a stand-alone mesh converter. Suddenly
		we have the means of making a many formats&rarr;custom format converter.
	</p>

	<h3>Export Scripts</h3>

	<p>
		Ultimately, what we really want is a set of export scripts, for different
		versions of different 3d modelling tools. We could then skip the building of
		the mesh converter, and go straight to a custom format. This is too much work
		to expect one person to do just to get a small demo to work, but would be ideal
		to have available for class assignments and that sort of thing.
	</p>

	<h3>Custom Format Design</h3>

	<p>
		With a working Assimp-based importer we can write out again to any format, and
		our graphics programme doesn't need to do any difficult parsing, or require
		any sort of parsing library. We can also leverage some of Assimp's extra
		functionality like generation of per-vertex tangents, and include these in the
		actual mesh file. These are used for normal-mapping. My ideal mesh format, for
		C, would have the following properties:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			All lines in file are easily parsed with <tt>fgets()</tt> or <tt>fscanf()</tt>,
			without needing to use <tt>strtok()</tt> to tokenise lines into components.
		</li>
		<li>
			No indents, braces, named nodes, or other sorts of structures appear in file.
		</li>
		<li>
			No materials, textures, lighting, scene, or camera information is stored in the
			file. This is more appropriately handled separately.
		</li>
		<li>
			A special tag line precedes sections of data.
		</li>
		<li>
			The zeroth [0] character in this line is a reserved character, '@'.
		</li>
		<li>
			The line gives; type of data following, count of lines following, and size of
			memory to allocate to fit the following data.
		</li>
		<li>
			Lines of data are always given in memory order, with no 'face' or 'polygon'
			lists that require assembly. The first vertex point line, or bone matrix line
			is therefore also always index number 0, the next line is always index number
			1, and so on. This increases file and memory size slightly, but for quicker
			and simpler parsing, and better human readibility and problem debugging.
		</li>
		<li>
			Able to store per-vertex tangents.
		</li>
		<li>
			Per-vertex bone indices given only by index number of that bone.
		</li>
		<li>
			Support for multiple animations per-mesh, and ease of pasting in additional
			animation sections after mesh file is first created.
		</li>
		<li>
			Root skeleton transform, and bone offset transformation sections clearly
			marked as such.
		</li>
		<li>
			Joints in the skeleton hierarchy are called "animated nodes". These do not have
			to be weighted to any vertices, but can be intermediate nodes that still
			contribute to the final animations.
		</li>
		<li>
			Nodes that are weighted to vertices have a "bone index", which index the bone
			offset matrices, and match the per-vertex "bone index".
		</li>
		<li>
			Animation keys are given in separate sections for each animation node.
		</li>
		<li>
			Animation keys are given separately for rotations, translations, and scales.
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		I went ahead and made such a format, and it worked flawlessly without any
		confusion. It is a great relief to have memory allocation requirements given
		up-front, so that the entire mesh can be allocated and created in one pass
		over the file, with very minimal parsing code. The only construction required
		is due to the simple format for the skeleton hierarchy. Each node only gives
		its parent, but when animating we typically want a list of all its children
		instead. In this case I opted for simplicity in mesh format at the expense
		of a little searching - perhaps giving a list of children might have been a
		slightly better idea, if messier.

		The first part of the per-vertex section of an example mesh is given below. This
		is my "dungeon door" test mesh.

		I give the "comps", or "number of components" for each data structure. This is
		in case you want to use it for 2d graphics, for example, and also to indicate,
		with the "count" of lines, the amount of memory to allocate for storage.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/customformat.png" /><br />
		<small><i>Testing an animation after importing from my custom format. The white
				squares indicate bone offset positions, and the different colours indicate
				different bone index numbers to which each part of the mesh is bound.</i></small>
	</div>

	<h3>Further Projects</h3>

	<p>
		I'm already using the format in my game "Crongdor the Barbarian". If it stands
		the test of a month or two I'll look at writing export scripts and publishing a
		little specification and simple skinned mesh with importer demo. I know for sure
		that this is going to be welcomed by people learning 3d graphics.
	</p>

	<p>
		It would also be trivial to create a matching JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
		version of this format for use in WebGL. There are already JSON formats in use
		in big WebGL projects like Three.js, so it might be a bit less useful for
		others.
	</p>

	<p>
		It's also worth keeping an eye on the Patrick Cozzi's gITF project of the
		Khronos Group, which
		is building a JSON mesh format and set of tools for solving much the same sort
		of problem across different graphics libraries. The Github page is
		<a href="https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/">https://github.com/KhronosGroup/glTF/</a>.
