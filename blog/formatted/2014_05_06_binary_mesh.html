	<h2>Binary Mesh Files</h2>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/binary_opengl_teapot.png" /><br />
		<small><i>
				Binary teapot mesh loaded into OpenGL. It was very easy to convert an .obj into
				a .bin. File size was about the same. Parsing time was much quicker, because it
				is pre-arranged into the order that it will be copied into vertex buffer
				objects.
			</i></small>
	</div>

	<p>
		I've been curious about binary mesh files for a while. I wrote a Wavefront .obj
		to binary converter tool. It has the following advantages:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			There is no need for any mark-up or descriptive text.
		</li>
		<li>
			Precision of <tt>float</tt>s are preserved exactly.
		</li>
		<li>
			Data can be written in exactly the format that you intend to load it into
			buffers e.g. it can be interleaved.
		</li>
		<li>
			Mesh data is obfuscated and difficult to reverse engineer.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Eliminating all of the cladding text makes the file much smaller, especially if
		the format has a lot of descriptive text for each data point. Wavefront .obj is
		actually pretty sparse - points are preceded by only 3 bytes of descriptive
		text, but XML or other formats like IFC use a huge amount of bloat so the saving
		would be much higher for those.
	</p>

	<p>
		With a <tt>float</tt> stored in 4 bytes you get exactly what you intend - there
		is no data loss by rounding floats to 2 decimal points, as you might do in a
		text format, nor is there an excessive data cost - text formats with 8 s.f.
		cost double what they should do and still do not guaranty full precision.
	</p>

	<p>
		Pre-ordering your data is pretty neat. This means that your parsing time is
		absolutely trivial - I only needed 5 lines of basic C code to copy the file data
		into vertex buffer objects. The down-side here is that you lose the minor
		optimisation that .obj files have with regards to redundant data. Sometimes the
		binary files are smaller, sometimes there is not much saving. I didn't expect
		this. You could add a similar face-indexing idea but this is not hugely
		attractive. If you are doing flat-shading and do not have texture coordinates
		then you can swoop in and add the data for an indexing buffer - then you get
		the best of both smaller file size and parsing straight into buffers.
	</p>

	<p>
		If you wanted to protect your original 3d model data, you make it a bit
		difficult to convert back into .obj because you would need to know or work out
		the layout of the data. You could make this even more proprietary and difficult
		if you really wanted to.
	</p>

	<p>
		For a basic interleaved vertex data binary file, all I needed to do was write
		a header of 1 integer size which contained the number of points in the mesh,
		then just a fixed arrangement of floats per point - XYZSTXYZ, where I had the
		position, the texture coordinate, and the normal for each point. Very trivial to
		parse because you can allocate all the memory as soon as you read the first
		integer. To support splitting by group (sub-mesh) or to indicate that you will
		have animation data at the end, then I just add a further variable or two to the
		header.
	</p>

	<h3>WebGL</h3>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/binary_webgl_teapot.png" /><br />
		<small><i>
				Binary teapot mesh loaded into WebGL. Parsing is quicker, and the file
				is much smaller than a JSON mesh, but the parsing in JavaScript is very ugly.
			</i></small>
	</div>

	<p>
		I also made a WebGL viewer. This turns out to be a bit more tricky, but there is
		a certain attraction to using a more efficient format for transmission over the
		web. JavaScript's binary file reading capabilities are not very good. After
		reading the file with AJAX you have to manipulate read data with bitwise
		operators - yuck. I found a really nice example implementation of this
		<a href="http://fhtr.blogspot.ie/2009/12/3d-models-and-parsing-binary-data-with.htm">on this blog</a>.
		There's something ever so slightly wrong with it but I can't quite put my finger
		on it - it won't read the very last byte in a file because it thinks it doesn't
		exist. There's an alternative, similar to how glTF works, by providing a JSON
		file layout description
		<a href="http://blog.vjeux.com/2011/javascript/binaryparser-unleash-javascript-power.html">here</a>
		although I'm not 100% clear on how that works as there are some broken links.
		Anyway, I got a JavaScript binary reader coded, and it does a nice, and
		extremely fast job of parsing the files. The downside is that the binary files
		aren't as small as I'd like them to be. It's possible to add zip-style
		compression but JavaScript unzippers look a bit unreliable, or at least
		unorthodox. This is on my TODO list to try.
	</p>

	<h2>Fullscreen WebGL</h2>

	<p>
		I found out how to get WebGL to go fullscreen. It's very hack-ish. You need to
		make a browser-specific request for a specific DOM element to be made
		fullscreen. This can be the HTML5 canvas. There's one for Three.js called
		<a href="http://learningthreejs.com/data/THREEx/docs/THREEx.FullScreen.html">THREEx.Fullscreen</a>
		that wraps this multi-browser behaviour. This actually works generically - it's
		not Three.js specific. The browser won't allow you to request fullscreen on load
		because this would be really annoying for users. Instead, you have to embed the
		request inside some sort of DOM callback or event action thing. The common
		approach is to put that inside a key-press callback but that's actually really
		annoying too because it's a surprise and happens every time you click back onto
		the browser tab - a huge pain when you're debugging. Example code doing this is
		also inefficient because it makes perspective calculation and uniform updates
		every single frame that a key is pressed or held - this will wreck your WebGL
		frame rate.
	</p>

	<p>
		I tied the callback to a check-box button instead. Then the user is explicitly
		aware of what they are doing and have full control. In this way the callback
		only fires on the button click so I can also make sure that perspective
		recalculation only occurs once. Unfortunately there is quite some delay between
		the request and the actual resize taking place. In this time you keep
		rendering. You could resize the canvas and the perspective aspect ratio every
		single frame, but instead I just check if the size has changed since last time.
		Still not ideal.
	</p>

	<h2>Android Devices</h2>

	<p>
		I make no secret of it - I think Android devices suck. Everything about their
		user interface irritates me. There is no standard green indicator LED for "I'm
		charging/plugged in" or blinking for "I need to charge". Half the cables don't
		work properly so it would be great to know these things. Instead you get a lazy
		pop-up image of an AA battery. What does that mean? Empty? Full? Hungry? Broken?
		Charging? And it won't turn on. When it eventually reaches about 5% charge you
		hold down the power button for far too long to turn it on. Then you get a motor
		vibration, not a light or a pop-up or anything - a slight motor vibration to
		let you know that it's booting. Grrrr! Anyway, this is a post-to-self to remind
		me of another couple of huge UI annoyances [eye twitch]
	</p>

	<h3>To log in with school wifi</h3>

	<ul>
		<li>
			Choose main compsci wireless (staff), compsci2 is postgrads
		</li>
		<li>
			Choose PEAP
		</li>
		<li>
			Don't leave default - choose MSVCHAP2 for secondary auth.
		</li>
		<li>
			There is an <b>un-indicated scroll down</b> to see user log-in info
		</li>
		<li>
			Identity = staff user name
		</li>
		<li>
			Pass = staff pass
		</li>
		<li>
			Set <b>manual</b> proxy with school's www-proxy for http 8080.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		A vertical scroll-bar as used everywhere in all other computing would be a great
		idea for Android to think about adopting. I had no idea the rest of the form
		was there until I accidentally swiped down on the input form.
	</p>

	<h3>Re-enable WebGL Support in Chrome</h3>

	<p>
		Updating Chrome usually breaks webgl support as Google alternates between
		deciding if the GPU is on the "okay" list or not, and the extensions to enable
		WebGL change. Major pain in the butt.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://get.webgl.org">http://get.webgl.org</a> to check support.</li>
		<li><a href="chrome://flags">chrome://flags</a></li>
		<li>Enable the first flag - <b>Override software rendering list</b></li>
		<li>Disable - <b>Disable WebGL</b> (some versions of Chrome)</li>
		<li>Enable - <b>Enable WebGL</b> (other versions of Chrome)</li>
		<li><a href="about://gpu">about://gpu</a> - check status</li>
		<li>Try the first link again</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>WebGL is Better than OpenGLES on Android</h2>

	<p>
		Once I got WebGL rendering properly I threw some (rather complex) demos at the
		Nexus tablet. I use very minimalist, event-driven JavaScript and rely on
		shaders and the raw power of the GPU to do most of my processing. Tablets and
		phones have some <u>very</u> capable graphics hardware. <b>WebGL works really
			well on the Nexus</b>. I will no longer bother building OpenGL ES on Android.
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>The default Java environment for Android is a horrible time-wasting, slow,
			over-engineered abomination, no doubt designed to make life easier to web
			developers. It's leagues behind the iOS development kit. I've pretty much got
			the view that Java's day has passed and I will not use it again.</li>
		<li>The NDK (native C development kit) is hands down the <b>absolute worst
				development environment</b> that I have ever used anywhere. This really turned
			me off buying an Android. They've taken a free operating system and broken it -
			replacing Unix philosophy GNU tools and C functionality with bits and pieces of
			scrappy horrible rubbish that wastes a lot of time to get running together.
			You're locked out from building natively on the device, and have to contrive
			these disgusting custom app builds and copy them over. Some of the official
			demos work. It took me a week to get a 3d object on the screen.</li>
		<li>WebGL can be developed anywhere, with just a text editor. Browsers have
			fairly okay tools for debugging built in.</li>
		<li>WebGL is built once, and the same software will run on Android browsers,
			and almost all desktop browsers. Android apps only run on android (sometimes).
		</li>
		<li>WebGL is incredibly fast to build. No compile times - just refresh the
			browser. Occasionally you do get hung up on a horrible surprise JavaScript bug.
		</li>
		<li>You have pretty good control over file fetching and compression with
			JavaScript. It's not as good as desktop C, but far superior to Android's awful
			Java AssetManager, which can not be avoided by the NDK - you have to bridge to
			it with the JNI, which I will never ever use again. Some work-arounds are
			required for binary files and zip compression.</li>
		<li>In WebGL you get touch-screen controls for free via the very simple HTML5 DOM.</li>
		<li>Fullscreen support works really well on Android, and screen orientation/flip
			seems to be handled correctly without you having to do anything.</li>
		<li>I ran a very complex WebGL demo and it ran at top speed. EGL is doing a good
			job there I think.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		Now, if iOS would stop acting like a Japanese hold-out and unlock its webgl
		capability in the browser we would have an incredibly powerful "deliver 3d to
		all devices" platform. Apparently iOS has support for WebGL in its ads platform.
		I guess they're worried about losing income from their appstore bogus legalised
		gambling economy -
		didn't seem to bother Google though so maybe it's just being cautious about
		drivers.
