	<h3>Mesh Loading</h3>
	<p>
		It looks like the best way to go is going to be to use a native JSON format file.<br />
		<del>Essentially this means that I don't have to write a mesh parser at all, which is nice</del>.<br />
		To get to JSON I was originally looking at using a Python script to convert .obj to .json but it looks like there
		is...<br />
		<del>...an exporter for <a href="http://http://www.blender.org/">Blender3D</a>
			called <a href="http://code.google.com/p/blender-machete/">"Machete"</a> which is probably a more elegant
			solution. Cutting edge?...I had some errors with Machete, but found this
			<a href="http://www.tamats.com/blog/?p=169">.obj to .json Python script</a>. This could go on a server that stores
			.objs but there's no reason not to batch process the lot off-line.
		</del><br />
		<br />
		<b><i>tl;dl: I have to write a programme to convert .obj meshes into .json files.</i></b>.
	</p>
	<p>New plan:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Demo to load hand-made (or pre-made) JSON mesh file</li>
		<li>Write my own programme or script to convert or export to JSON</li>
		<li>Profit!</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		I got a mesh loading from a JSON file:
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<a href="https://antongerdelan.net/demos/jsonmesh/"><img src="../images/cubejsonmesh.png" width="512" /></a><br />
		<small><i>
				this is a rotating box-oid that I loaded from a file in JSON format. all points are in one huge array so it
				plugs right into the gl data operation [x y z x y z x y.. ]etc..
			</i></small>
	</div>

	<h3>next...</h3>

	<p>It wasn't difficult to get that working, but there isn't a strict format for a JSON mesh to be in. The exporters
		and converters were a bit of a let-down, but I already have
		a C parser of .obj files, so perhaps I can turn this into a little JSON creater in my own layout. Should be the
		quickest option.</p>
