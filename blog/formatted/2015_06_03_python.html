		After experimenting with a debug 1st-person camera view in my ongoing Crongdor
		the Barbarian game development, I thought it would be cool to make a first
		person game. Amazingly, I have never done this, despite these being the
		inspiration for a lot of my career choices. I wanted to make an eerie Underworld
		type of game but it ended up gravitating itself into a blend of Wolfenstein 3-D,
		Dangerous Dave in the Haunted Mansion, with a bit of Blake Stone, Nightmare 3-D,
		and Ken's Labyrinth nodded to. Of course WebGL was the medium.
	</p>

		<small><i>I drew a pixel-art map in GIMP, with a unique colour for each game

	</div>

	<p>
		I decided to do yet another cube-ish blocks plan to make level design easy and
		retro. I put GIMP in pixel mode, disabled anti-aliasing, and drew a map using
		unique colours for each type of wall, item, monster, etc. I used HTML5
		Canvas2D to load the image and extract each pixel's colour as an unique
		number, which is the code to load a specific item at a location determined by
		pixel row and column number * 2.0 to get into world co-ordinates.

				them, silly retro sound jingles - it needed to be recreated!

	</div>

	<p>
		Upon seeing the first 3d rendering of my game level I was hit by a nostalgia
		bomb from early 90s 3d games and it just sort of turned into a mash-up of
		those, with some Dangerous Dave action thrown in.
	</p>

	<p>
		Interestingly I didn't need to do much in the way of culling optimisation. It
		was okay to have one draw per wall section, thing, monster, etc. The bottleneck,
		even on my piece of crap laptop was the fragment count and/or fill rate, so I
		just did some crude dot-product culls and reduced the viewport size.
	</p>

	<p>
		Keys, locked doors, secret panels, treasure, and so on were all very easy to
		do. Low-res pixel art looks nice and is really quick to make. I disabled all
		anti-aliasing in the rendering. The monsters I could not be bothered animating,
		I just loaded a different mesh to use for the "attacking" state. Some neat
		shaders to make stuff flash in an old-school way to indicate damage were a
		nice idea and easy to do. That plus sound queues was enough - no need for
		particles or anything fancy. I think making a really old-style surround HUD
		for the player's stats set a tone - I used similar colours to the crappy
		dull palettes of 90s games. I rendered to a smaller viewport inside this for
		the 3d stuff - same as how the original games worked. The text using CSS and
		native browser text was such a relief - really clear text is so nice to have.
		Doing text rendering in OpenGL is an exercise in disappointing frustration.
		I implemented Doom/Underworld's diminished lighting to give a spooky tone,
		and didn't bother with Phong or anything - just normal-based basic shading,
		which is cheap and nice looking. I'm less and less impressed with expensive,
		difficult-to-manage traditional lighting models. I added a flare alpha-blended
		thing to make lamps look like they're shining - worked really well. Sorting
		transparent objects by distance was trivial in JavaScript - yay!
	</p>

	<p>
		I finally figured out how to pre-load sound effects with Howler. It required
		reading the instructions. I found it doesn't work on my mobile phone though -
		humm.
	</p>

	<p>
		For the AI spotting the player I just used Bresenham's line drawing to see if
		sight was blocked by a wall - not accurate but accurate enough. For shooting
		I used an interesting little algorithm - distance of a point from a line plotted
		between two points. Simple and effective! The point being the monster in question
		and the line being the forward vector of the camera. I didn't bother doing a
		wall collision check, so you can shoot through walls at short distances. It
		worked really well, and means you can shoot multiple baddies with a single
		shot.
	</p>

	<p>
		The story I based on an artistic "thing" two of my friends in the graphics
		group were doing. The main character is lifted/reproduced from Tim's
		<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.survivaltrail&hl=en">Survival Trail</a> game, where he is
		the main character. Had to.
	</p>

	<p>
		I think the only thing I wasn't happy with was that the boss drops the key in
		a slightly wrong location which sometimes disappears - didn't quite figure that
		out. Must be a rounding error or invalid parameter somewhere?
	</p>

	<h3>Python</h3>

	<p>
		I'm having yet another crack at learning Python for the purposes of making a
		Blender script, some visualisation data pre-processing, and just generally
		sharpening a new tool. I want to get learn enough to
		evaluate the language's usefulness for my own purposes. I suspect there are
		some general scripting and file parsing tasks that will make it a superior
		choice in some cases, and I would like to investigate the GUI potential for
		mutli-platform native OS tools, as at the moment I have no really nice tool
		for this.
	</p>

	<p>
		I've to-date put off learning Python properly, because like all cute
		technologies it has a voracious community of hooded fanatics that want you to
		py-everything, and frankly I find that very offputting - some sort of
		psychological shortcoming, a tendancy to tribalism perhaps - that catches a
		lot of humanity and makes them especially difficult to tolerate.
	</p>

	<p>
		I'm putting my notes and stuff <a href="https://github.com/capnramses/lang/tree/master/python">github</a>.
		So far I've found it a lot more difficult to learn and deal with than JavaScript,
		which I can't help but compare it to. It has some extra powerful features, but
		is just different enough to other languages to be difficult to learn as quickly
		as I would like.
	</p>

	<p>
		I managed to create a working exporter script for Blender to
		<a href="https://github.com/capnramses/apg_mesh">my own
			3d mesh format</a>. I feel another pass over this once I've improved my Python
		skills would be beneficial. I need to add support for export of bones, skeleton
		hierarchy, and animations, but the per-vertex core of data is working.
	</p>

	<h3>New Debugging Tools and Text Editors</h3>

	<p>
		I want to try some more visual C/C++ debuggers for non-windows. I only want
		light-weight tools, not full IDEs, but having the ability to click breakpoints,
		maintain a watchlist, inspect the call stack side-by-side, and most importantly
		<b>inspect the compiled assembler code</b>, would be a great insight to writing more
		efficient code.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Insight, a GDB GUI - <a href="https://www.sourceware.org/insight/">https://www.sourceware.org/insight/</a></li>
		<li>DDD, another GDB front-end - <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/">http://www.gnu.org/software/ddd/</a>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<P>
		I had a go with Microsoft Visual Studio Code, which is available on Linux and
		Apple ?!!?! It's a very light IDE with some debug support for web development
		and .: completely useless.
	</P>

	<p>
		All the cool kids are using Sublime Text editor these days. I recently wrote a
		post giving my opinion on plug-ins being a massive waste of time. This is the
		extreme end of that. It's a text editor presenting a sensible interface, with
		all the advantages of non-sensible Vim and Emacs. It's a very nice text editor,
		nicer than gedit, which I use a lot. I find a lot of the fancy productivity
		enhancers end up wasting my time by accidentally clicking twice and getting
		two cursors or something. It has a very good JSON validator (and other code
		validators) which will put big red stuff over bad bracket endings and stuff,
		which is very handy indeed if you work in these areas. Nice but not better
		overall than what I've been using.
		You can do some interesting compile-as-you-type stuff with C, which I've heard
		from very authoritive sources is a big development-time improver. Have not
		tried yet. I can't see that being so useful for me because I often work on a
		junkyard laptop, and I never make mistakes.
