	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>6 Jan 2014</h2>
	<h3>Made a PHP Blog Thingy</h3>

	<p>
		I wanted to resurrect my research notes because I have stuff to put up, but they
		had gotten a bit big and unwieldy. I didn't want to install a big Wordpress or
		other plug-in solution OTT thing because yuck, so I made my own with a bit of
		PHP. I wanted to just have a folder, where if I dropped a file of text in it
		would auto-magically appear in a list of links on the left-hand side of this
		page. Then you click on them, but instead of taking you to a new page it just
		grabs the contents of the file and smacks them onto another part of the page.
		They are just alphabetically ordered by file name, so I name them with the date
		in European format; <i>YYYY-MM-DD</i>. This also means that I can find the
		latest one easily to use as the default post to display. Super simple. Anyway,
		it worked. I used this PHP code:
	</p>

	<textarea rows=38>
<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>

<?php
print "
<table><tr><td valign=\"top\"><small>
";
// read all the posts from index file
$blatest = true;
$content_file = "";
$dir = "posts";
$files = scandir ($dir, 1);
$arrayLength = count($files);
for ($i = 0; $i < $arrayLength - 2; $i++) {
	$fn = $files[$i];
	echo "<a href=\"#\" onclick=\"return pop_content('$fn');\">$fn<br />";
	if ($blatest) {
		$blatest = false;
		$content_file = "posts/$fn";
	}
}
print "</small></td>";
// display the content of default post
$param_post = $_GET['post'];
// allow ?post=2014_01_06
$len = strlen ($param_post);
if ($len == 10) {
	$content_file = "posts/$param_post";
}
$content = file_get_contents ($content_file);
print "
</small></td><td td valign=\"top\" id=\"content_td\">
";
print $content;
print "
</td></tr>
</table>
";
?></textarea>

	<p>
		And I have a couple of JavaScript functions that pull out the content of a given
		post's file as a string and drop it into the appropriate part of the page. I can
		just write plain HTML into the post files to do formatting and insert images. No
		markdown nonsense or anything like that.
	</p>

	<textarea rows=16>
<script type="text/javascript">
	function get_string_from_URL(url) {
		var xmlhttp = new XMLHttpRequest();
		xmlhttp.open("GET", url, false);
		xmlhttp.send();
		return xmlhttp.responseText;
	}

	function pop_content(file) {
		var path = "posts/" + file;
		var str = get_string_from_URL(path);
		var content_td = document.getElementById("content_td");
		content_td.innerHTML = str;
		return false;
	}
</script></textarea>

	<h3>Technical Report on Vertex Buffer Layouts</h3>

	<p>
		Another thing that I did recently was complete a technical report documenting
		my experiments with different vertex buffer layouts in OpenGL. There exist only
		vague notions that interleaving mesh data memory should draw faster than other
		layouts, so I put it to the test, and recorded about a week's worth of drawing
		time on a couple of different machines.
		I wrote it up in a LaTeX PDF:
		<a href="https://antongerdelan.net/opengl/buffers.pdf">buffers.pdf</a>.
		Note sure if/where to publish it yet.
	</p>

		<img src="../images/gpu_output_6_attrib.png" />
	</div>

	<p>
		I managed to measure the time that GL took on the CPU with <tt>glDrawArrays()</tt>,
		and also used a neat tool called APItrace to gather the corresponding GPU times
		taken on two different commodity graphics processors. I see afterwards that
		there's actually a GL extension to query to GPU time taken by a function, but
		API trace is nice in that it gives you some visualisations too, which can show
		how much one is lagging the other. The short story was that
		the different memory layouts alternatives don't make any significant difference
		to performance.

	<h3>WebGL Entry for Ludum Dare</h3>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/compo2/thumb/97c71073228f46a61369a6f462fe1f99.jpg" />
	</div>

	<p>
		I wanted to put my WebGL skills to the test so made an entry for the Ludum Dare
		48-hour game making competition. It's called Dolphin Rescue. The
		<a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-28/?action=preview&uid=30024">
			entry page is here
		</a>, and you can play it on-line at:
