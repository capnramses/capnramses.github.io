	<h3>Phong Lighting in Shaders</h3>
	<p>
		Nothing too hard to begin with;
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>I extended my .obj parser to export normals to the JSON, right after where I exported the array of texture
			coordinates (once again remebering
			to put a comma in-between).</li>
		<li>I created a new vertex buffer object, copied the data from the JSON file in, and</li>
		<li>Added a new per-vertex attribute in the same way that I added the attribute for texture coordinates</li>
		<li>I created a view matrix using <tt>lookAt</tt> from <tt>gl-Matrix.js</tt> and sent it in as a uniform variable
		</li>
		<li>I created a projection matrix using <tt>perspective</tt> from the same library</tt>
		<li>create a light position and some colours</li>
		<li>did all the usual calculations for ambient diffuse and specular components</li>
		<li>I sent my per-attribute normals straight to the fragment shader to use as a colour to make sure they were okay
			(see 1st picture, below)</li>
		<li>and then something weird happened...(see 2nd picture).</li>
	</ol>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/lc_normaltest.png" width="512" /><br />
		<small><i>Using the local-space normals (the unconverted values from my JSON file) as colours. Seems to be fine! Red
				= facing right, Green = Up, Blue = Forward</i></small><br />
		<img src="../images/ec_normalsTest.png" width="512" /><br />
		<small><i>Testing the normals after converting them to eye-space. (Red=To the view-point's right, Green=Up,
				blue=towards the view-point). But why does it look washed out? (Sorry ignore that the background colour is
				different).</i></small>
	</div>

	<p>
		At first I thought that I must be scaling my normals, and forgetting to re-normalise them. Then <i>nope</i> - still
		dark colours and grey-ish looking where it should be black.
		I used the dot product result and also its negative as colours - seemed fine. Then it occured to me that my usual
		lighting equation from OpenGL was doing something unexpected:</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<tt>vec4 Id = Ld * Kd * dot (s, normal); </tt>
	</div>

	<p><i>
			Where;<br />

			<ul>
				<li><tt>Id</tt> is the RGBA intensity of diffuse light</li>
				<li><tt>Ld</tt> is the RGBA colour of the diffuse light, and</li>
				<li><tt>Kd</tt> is the RGBA coefficient of diffuse reflection for the surface (I used my texture map for this),
				</li>
				<li><tt>dot (s, normal)</tt> gets the dot product (the angle between two vectors as a factor between 0 and 1) of
					the surface normal, and the direction (<tt>s</tt>) from the surface to the
					light source.</li>
			</ul>

		</i></p>

	<p>
		It works like this mathematically (component-wise multiplication):
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<tt>
			Id.r = Ld.r * Kd.r * factor;<br />
			Id.g = Ld.g * Kd.g * factor;<br />
			Id.b = Ld.b * Kd.b * factor;<br />
			Id.a = Ld.a * Kd.a * factor;<br />
		</tt>
	</div>

	<p>
		Now, the alpha channel is also multiplied by the factor. Normally, this doesn't do anything in OpenGL unless you
		explicitly enable a blend mode first. Then you can use it to
		make your fragments transparent. I suspected something so I set <tt>Id.a = 1.0</tt> after the lighting equation. And
		it fixed the problem! It turns out that in WebGL, there is
		a default blend mode enabled somewhere that was showing the background of the HTML page through the fragment -
		making it look grey (my webpage was grey).

	<h3>Virtual Camera with Controls</h3>

	<p>
		Getting started was pretty easy. You have two event systems that you can use. <tt>document.event</tt> and
		<tt>canvas.event</tt>. The canvas system is exactly the same,
		but only returns true for events if the mouse cursor is inside the canvas area. This would be handy for things like
		mouse-picking or checking for change of user focus.
		I found the focus a little problematic and ended up only allowing the mouse cursor to do things whilst a key was
		held down. You only get absolute screen pixel positions as well,
		so it limits your options for first-person cameras where you might want to keep turning around, even after when the
		mouse cursor reaches the side of the window. If you can
		design around these limitations then you are fine. The event system uses numbered codes to check for each keyboard
		key. There is a list here:
		<a
			href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1465374/javascript-event-keycode-constants">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1465374/javascript-event-keycode-constants</a>.
	</p>

	<div class="centre"><a href="https://antongerdelan.net/demos/virtualcamera/">
			<img src="../images/virtualcam.png" width="512" /></a><br />
		<small><i>You can use HTML5's built-in keyboard and mouse event system to easily grab user input for WebGL. Click to
				run demo.</i></small>
	</div>

	<p>
		I first went for the basics and wrote a Camera object where pressing W,A,S,D keys would move the camera along
		-Z,-X,+Z, and +X axes, respectively. No sweat but the camera was
		always facing forward. I used the mouse cursor to rotate a vector that I was using in the <tt>lookAt</tt> function.
		I ran into a very strange problem then. Moving forwards and
		backwards in the direction of the camera was fine, but left and right was not. I used the <tt>cross()</tt> function
		from <tt>gl-matrix.js</tt> to define a sideways-pointing
		vector, but the function was not returning the correct result when I laid it out like this: <tt>var sideVec =
			vec3.cross (forwardVec, [0 1 0]);</tt>. I changed the parameters
		around and set it up like: <tt>vec3.cross (forwardVec, [0, 1, 0], sideVec);</tt> and it was fine.
	</p>

	<h3>Next...</h3>

	<p>
		I dread implementing texture shadows in normal OpenGL. Do I dare? Probably not. I could move onto building a more
		generic engine type of thing but I don't have any real project
		specs yet. I guess I'm up to fluffing around with the experimental parts. I will need to do some animation software
		eventually, so perhaps I should have a look at building a
		hardware skinning demo using some sort of JSON script for animation.
