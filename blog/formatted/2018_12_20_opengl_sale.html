	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>Anton's OpenGL Stuff End of Year Sale</h2>

	<p>
		I'm on holidays since yesterday! I have a bit of time get back to side projects (and lifting weights).
		What better to celebrate this auspicious occasion than to bundle my OpenGL learning resources together in a sale.
	</p>

	<h3>Sale Bundle</h3>

	<p>
		You can get the <b>Anton's OpenGL 4 Tutorials</b> e-book, and <b>Crongdor the Barbarian</b> indie video game at
		discount on my itch.io page <a href="https://capnramses.itch.io/">https://capnramses.itch.io/</a>, or at an even
		higher bundled discount at <a
			href="https://itch.io/s/15742/antons-opengl-stuff-end-of-year-sale">https://itch.io/s/15742/antons-opengl-stuff-end-of-year-sale</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Crongdor the Barbarian is a game I wrote with OpenGL, and it ships with all the source code, so you can see how I
		did it, and maybe get some ideas for how to implement different effects, or how you can use the OpenGL API at scale
		beyond stand-alone demos,
		or just see how it bundles together so that it "runs on other peoples' computers". It's pretty straight-forward
		old-school C++ code
		( arrays, loops, and structs ) so should be reasonably easy to follow. I'd of course do a few things differently
		now, and I'm always happy to
		chat about code or anything game development related if you want to ask questions.
	</p>

	<h3>Other Resources</h3>

	<p>
		If you're learning, or want to know where to start with computer graphics - these might be handy or interesting too.
