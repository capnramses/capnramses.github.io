	<h2>Cracking Open Doom .wad Files - Part I: Hexin'</h2>

	<p>
		A hobby project that has been on my list since about 1994 was to figure out
		Doom's (Id Software, 1993) data file format - the vaunted <tt>DOOM.WAD</tt> file. My brother
		and I used to enjoy making maps with 3rd-party editing tools around 1994/5,
		which was a nice way to get a grip on the 3D technology involved in the game.
		When I started programming I occasionally looked at the Doom source code to see
		if I was at a level where I could have understood or made some of it. It took me
		many years. I tested my mettle a few years ago porting Doom - see
		<a href="https://antongerdelan.net/blog/formatted/2014_09_24_doom_src.html"> this blog post</a>,
		but left figuring out the WAD file for a future code expedition. There it remained.
		<i>But something happened that the WAD did not intend. It was picked up by the
			most unlikely creature imaginable...</i>
	</p>

	<p>
		I was coding late one night and thought <i>"Hmm, it would be nice to play the
			original Doom music while I code".</i>. Nothing on Youtube is the same, original "MIDI playing on an original
		Soundblaster" sound
		that I [lying] told myself I remembered differently.
		So I thought <i>"Well, I
			have Doom, why don't I just pull the music out of the game data directly?"</i>
		Thus, my tale begins. This will probably be a series of posts. <b>Aside:</b> Look, if you
		don't know me, then what I'm like is I'll intend to do one little thing and then
		I'll get completely obsessed, and binge code on the heavy metal for several days without sleeping
		(record code binge 38 hours, but that's another story), and it will get completely out of hand until a
		friend slaps me back to reality, which happened in this case. Guilty your Honour!
		This blog post will be a crazy journey to the centre of my mind - but - I'm also going
		to explain all the tools and techniques in such a way that a student should be able
		to follow easily enough.
	</p>

	<h3>Where <i>is</i> All the Data? (WAD)</h3>

	<p>
		The WAD is a binary file with a custom layout that smushes together all of the
		game's data assets - images, sounds, music. There are two types of WAD - the
		main IWAD (Id software WAD I guess) [note: I wrote it stands for "internal WAD"
		in my source, but I may have made that up], and PWAD - patch WAD. This allows players to
		make a little third-party custom add on like their own map, that overwrites one
		of the game's maps at start-up so that they can play it. We made PWADs of our
		own maps in 1994. I probably still have them on a mouldering floppy disk in New
		Zealand, but I couldn't find them last time I was there, sadly.
	</p>

	<h3>Hexin'</h3>

	<p>
		Unlike plain-text files, binary files are a little tricky to read because you
		can't just open them in a text editor and see the data. You can open them in a
		hex-editor though and inspect the value of each byte of data. Hex editors display
		each byte as a two-digit hexadecimal number. A byte can store 256 combinations,
		so e.g. the numbers 0-255, or representing an ASCII character from that numbered
		set of 128 characters 'a' (value 97), 'B', etc. Hexadecimal represents 16 values
		per digit, rather than decimal 10 - so 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F, where
		"F" corresponds to decimal 15. Hex is used because you only need 2
		digits/characters to display each byte of data, thus 255 in decimal is rendered
		as "FF" in hex. If you've ever edited a web-page you may have seen colours
		expressed in hex like <tt>0xFFFFFF</tt>. That's actually 3 bytes, one after the
		other, not one huge number. One for red, one for green, and one for the blue
		component of the colour, respectively. If all are set to 255 or FF then you get
		white, as we would here. <tt>0xFF0000</tt> would be bright red.
	</p>

	<p>
		I use <tt>hexedit</tt>
		on GNU/Linux from the terminal. I wanted to go in cold and see if I could figure
		everything out myself with no starter information. People have done this many
		times over the years, and I didn't want them to spoil the challenge for me
		(horrifying and shameful discovery about this later).
		The first task in inspecting a binary file in a hex-editor is to find some
		strings of ASCII text. Usually you have a column on the right-hand side that
		shows what the ASCII characters are or would be for each byte's value. In this
		way you can scan for some named sections in the file, which is a nice hint.
		By the way, never encode anything in a string if it's meant to be kept <i>secret</i> or <i>safe</i>,
		even in a compiled program - these will show up here.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/hexedit.png" width="512" /><br />
		<small>Finding strings in the DOOM.WAD file with Hexedit.</small>
	</div>

	<p>
		You can see in the above image what hex editing looks like. In the image you can
		see I've found a section in the binary with consecutive byte values
		corresponding to valid strings of English text. You can tab between the two
		columns (hex and strings) to see which byte corresponds to each character. You
		can see that the
		bytes above the strings sometimes hold numbers that correspond to an 'a', but
		this is not intentional. You can also use hexedit to modify the data in the
		binary file directly. I showed my class how to hack [redacted]ents in [redacted] last
		year with this approach.
	</p>

	<p>
		A good string to search for in Doom might be the name of the first map/level:
		"E1M1". To search for strings in hexedit you press TAB to switch over to the
		ASCII column, then press the '/' key and type in the string (case sensitive - try
		upper-case).
	</p>

	<p>
		Once we've found something to grab onto in the file like strings, we can start
		to determine the structure of the file. You'll note that each string:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Actually reads like a section heading or title.</li>
		<li>They all appear in a cluster.</li>
		<li>There are some bytes of non-string data in the same region.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		There are two nice ways of structuring files; inline section headings, and
		a file directory that is stored in the header or footer of the file.
		I used the inline approach in <a href="https://github.com/capnramses/apg_mesh">my 3D mesh file format</a>.
		These are designed so that you can parse all of the data in the file in one pass
		from top to bottom. Each block of data or variables has a little header separator
		that says how much and what type of data follows, so that the user can allocate
		memory on the fly and just gobble it in without pause.
		Directories, on the other hand, store all the little headers in a block. These typically are
		structured like this:
	</p>

	<pre>
DIRECTORY
 ->entry
   ->entry name string or type ID
   ->size of section blocks in bytes
   ->number or composition of section blocks
   ->offset into file data where section starts
</pre>

	<p>
		We can tell that Doom used the directory type, except this is stored at the end
		of the file rather than in a header at the start. There are other types of file
		structure but we will not speak of those, lesser, formats here. Reading through
		the directory strings you can get a sense of the structure - certain repeating
		strings in-between each map name indicate bits and pieces of each map. After the
		maps we see other sections - <tt>D_E1M1</tt> is probably the music track for the
		first map. At this point what we can do is parse the directory in a little
		program. Then we can read whatever we want out...why not spit out all the sounds,
		music, images, and so on whilst we are at it? Why not recreate all the maps in
		3D...crawl right into the heads of the people who made the game and see how they
		were wired...argh! You can see my problem. But first - how do we jump down to
		where the directory starts? There must be a little header at the top of the file
		that tells us where to start reading it from.
	</p>

	<h3>Reading The Header</h3>

	<p>
		I wrote a little program in C to read the WAD. Most people would lean towards
		a scripting language, but I actually find most of these tend to be a bit too
		high level - I don't care about containers and iterators, I just want direct
		access to the bytes I'm reading. And I'm very, very quick at writing in C
		(I listen to heavy metal remember), so away with your scripts!
		Our basic tools of the trade in reading binary files are:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><tt>fread()</tt> - read a given amount of binary data into whatever.</li>
		<li><tt>fwrite()</tt> - write a given amount of binary data into whatever.</li>
		<li><tt>fseek()</tt> - jump file pointer to a given offset in a file for future reads.</li>
		<li>String comparison functions like <tt>strncmp()</tt> or <tt>strcmp()</tt>.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		The file pointer is like a cursor where you are currently reading from. It starts
		at the top of the file, but you can shift it around before calling <tt>fread()</tt>
		again so that it reads from an earlier or later location. If you are on Linux or
		Mac and want to bring up the API manual pages for a particular function from
		the standard headers type into a terminal window:
	</p>

	<pre>
man 3 fread
</pre>

	<p>
		Where `3` indicates that you want to look up a library function name, not a
		command line program of the same name, if both exist.
	</p>

	<p>
		We can quickly determine the header for the WAD format from hexedit. The very
		left-hand column of hexedit gives you the address or offset of the start of each
		row of bytes. If we note down where the directory starts - the start of the row
		in the image above, where the strings start, is <tt>00 BC C5 C0</tt>. We can look
		for a similar value stored near the start of the file. You can also search for a byte value too, if you tab back to
		the hex
		section. CTRL+X quits, by the way. You can type <tt>man hexedit</tt> to bring up
		the man pages for hexedit.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/hexeditb.png" width="512" /><br />
		<small>Finding the directory offset in the header (highlighted).</small>
	</div>

	<p>
		Near the start of the file we see <tt>C4 C5 BC 00</tt> which is a backwards version
		of our directory row start offset, but just 4 bytes off. Why backwards? Most
		binary data files are stored in "little endian" order - the smallest bytes
		appear first / on the left. Here we have an integer value that spans 4 bytes.
		The "little endian" name is a reference to Gulliver's Travels. Some special
		architectures still prefer big-endian (but most are compatible with little-endian).
		Notably socket programming packets still use big-endian, and you would use a
		set of functions to convert your data to and from this. We don't need to do anything
		here - our <tt>fread</tt> function already knows to expect little-endian. If you
		look up info on binary file reading on "helpful" Q&A websites everybody will try
		to get you to make your code more portable or something by being excessively
		pedantic about this. This is a load of garbage - I actively avoid these websites/<i>besser-wisserer</i>.

#include <stdio.h>

char pwad_iwad[5]; // "IWAD" or "PWAD"
int dir_nentries;
int dir_location; // integer holding pointer

int main() {
	// open the file in "read binary" mode
	FILE *f = fopen( "DOOM.WAD", "rb" );
	if ( !f ) {
		fprintf( stderr, "ERROR opening `%s`\n", DOOM.WAD );
		return 1;

	return 0;
}</textarea>

	<p>
		The above code is my starting snippet.
		The header is just 3 groups of 4-byte values. We can see the first is the
		string of chars saying what type of file it is (note: no null-terminator
		character here, so I added an extra char at the end of my string for this).
		The third group of 4-bytes is our directory offset. And an educated guess suggests
		that the middle holds the number of items in the directory. I should point out
		that I didn't get this right first time - there was some trial and error and
		sailor-language. Note that
		you can use <tt>fread()</tt> to read any number of bytes into any sort of
		variable or array. They don't work so well at reading and writing structs though,
		for various reasons - be warned! It's easy to make mistakes reading from binary
		files, so I always assert that the number of items read (the return values)
		matches my expectations.
	</p>

	<h3>Reading the Directory</h3>

	<p>
		We can add another block to read in the directory into a generic structure
		before we close the file. We can see that the directory starts a few bytes ahead
		of our first string, but it took a bit of fiddling around, with much the same
		match-and-guess method to get this right. You can sort-of confirm this data
		layout by looking at some slightly unreliable info in old docs <a
			href="http://www.gamers.org/dhs/helpdocs/dmsp1666.html">from 1994</a>,
		or the various Doom wikis. I should probably mention that I was too lazy to
		verify most of this - so there may be errors in my binary data layout assumptions.
		I stored each directory entry's meta-data in a struct. I call each block of data
		referred to by the directory entry a "lump" (certain song instantly stuck in head?). There's a whole blob (binary
		large object),
		lump, wad... silly naming thing going on in the binary file world. For
		<a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/467790/Crongdor_the_Barbarian/">Crongdor</a>
		I had to binary-up all the music files for licensing reasons. I called these files "VOM"
		(volume of music). Yeah...
	</p>

	<textarea rows="31">
typedef struct Lump {
	int location; // integer holding pointer
	int bytes;
	char name[9];
} Lump;
Lump *lumps; // a buffer for all directory entries

{ // DIRECTORY (usually this is at end of WAD file)
	// SEEK_SET is offset from start of file. SEEK_CUR is from current fptr
	int ret = fseek( f, (long)dir_location, SEEK_SET );
	assert( ret != -1 );

	lumps = (Lump *)malloc( sizeof( Lump ) * dir_nentries );
	assert( lumps );

	printf( "lump names =\n" );
	size_t ritems = 0;
	for ( int i = 0; i < dir_nentries; i++ ) {
		ritems = fread( &lumps[i].location, 4, 1, f );
		assert( ritems == 1 );

		ritems = fread( &lumps[i].bytes, 4, 1, f );
		assert( ritems = 1 );

		ritems = fread( lumps[i].name, 1, 8, f );
		assert( ritems = 8 );
		lumps[i].name[8] = '\0';
		printf( "%s ", lumps[i].name );
	}
	printf( "\n" );
}</textarea>

	<p>
		You can see that I use <tt>fseek</tt> to jump to reading from the directory,
		using the location that we read from the header. I allocate memory so that each
		directory entry has its own struct, and then read them all in in a loop. Now we
		hold the Keys to the Kingdom!
	</p>

	<p>
		If you print the lump names as you read them in you can get a pretty good idea
		of what the contents are.
	</p>

	<h3>Plopping Out the WAD Contents</h3>

	<p>
		If you want to you can extract most lumps from the WAD directly now - you just
		<tt>fseek</tt> to their location, <tt>fread</tt> their number of bytes out into
		a buffer of that size, and <tt>fwrite</tt> them into a new file, using their
		name as the filename. This is where I discovered my first hurdle.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The music files are not typical '90s MIDI files.</li>
		<li>The sound files also use a proprietary format.</li>
		<li>Some images are in a custom [slightly] compressed format.</li>
		<li>All of the images use the older, palette-based colour format.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		At this point I decided that I really needed to extract all the data, not just
		the music files. Of course!
	</p>

	<h3>Colour Palette</h3>

	<p>
		I'd actually come across Doom's palette system before in my porting project, so
		I knew how to deal with that already. The walls and floors are all very simple
		N*M pixels of raw data, except that each pixel stores an index into a palette
		instead of an RGB colour (red-blue-green channels, like the HTML colours). The palette index holds the RGB colour.
		This allowed
		for smaller image sizes, worked on older <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/8-bit_color">VGA 320x200</a>
		devices that didn't have Truecolor (RGB rather than palettes) support yet, and enabled some nifty colour
		shifting special effects because you could just modify the palette being used
		to change the shades of all the colours on screen.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/doom_palette.gif" />
	</div>

	<p>
		If you printed out the directory entry names you'd see that there are actually
		a series of colour palette stored in the WAD. Only one can be used for the
		screen at a time - the others were swapped in for special effects. One palatte
		tints everything green for when the player is
		wearing the radiation suit. There are a series of red shades for producing an
		animated "hurt" effect, based on how much damage the player takes, and some
		flashes for item pickups, etc. The best way to demonstrate this was to write
		them all out as images, and animate the series as a GIF.
	</p>

	<p>
		Other games based on the Doom engine (Heretic, Hexen, Strife, Doom II...) also
		had colour palettes, and similar WAD formats. Here I also animate Heretic's
		palettes - you can see the different choice of colours for a different mood.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/heretic_palette.gif" />
	</div>

	<p>
		If you store the palettes (the first one is the default - you really only want
		this) then you can write out the images as raw data files, or convert them to
		e.g. PNG - I used <a href="https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image_write.h">stb_image_write</a>,
		because it's simple. Palettes are in the <tt>PLAYPAL</tt> lump.
	</p>

	<textarea rows="22">
byte_t *palettes[PAL_MAX];

{ // read palettes
	int ret = fseek( f, (long)lumps[dir_idx].location, SEEK_SET );

	for ( int palette_idx = 0; palette_idx < PAL_MAX; palette_idx++ ) {
		const size_t palette_sz = 768;
		palettes[palette_idx] = (byte_t *)malloc( palette_sz );

			assert( ret != 0 );
		}
	}
}</textarea>

	<p>
		I wrote some convenience types to represent the RGB colours, and a function to
		look up an RGB from a palette index:
	</p>

	<textarea rows="14">
// for convenience
typedef struct rgb_t { byte_t r, g, b; } rgb_t;

// for convenience/safety
rgb_t rgb_from_palette( byte_t colour_idx ) {
	assert( colour_idx < 256 && colour_idx >= 0 );

	rgb_t rgb;
	rgb.r = palettes[0][colour_idx * 3];
	rgb.g = palettes[0][colour_idx * 3 + 1];
	rgb.b = palettes[0][colour_idx * 3 + 2];

	return rgb;
}</textarea>

	<h3>Writing out "Flats"</h3>

	<p>
		The floor and ceiling images are called "flats", and stored between lumps named
		<tt>F_START</tt> and <tt>F_END</tt>. Names vary a bit depending on the version
		of the WAD. They are pretty easy to write out - we just need to look up the
		RGB value of each pixel from our palette.
	</p>

	<textarea rows=29>
	// look up palette RGB for each bytes and draw with stb_image
	const size_t flat_sz = 4096;
	byte_t *index_buff = alloca( flat_sz );
	assert( index_buff );

	byte_t *pixel_buff = alloca( flat_sz * 3 ); // rgb
	assert( pixel_buff );

	int ret = fseek( f, (long)lumps[dir_idx].location, SEEK_SET );
	assert( ret != -1 );
	size_t ritems = fread( index_buff, 1, flat_sz, f );
	if ( ritems != lumps[dir_idx].bytes ) {
		printf( "%s\n", curr_lump_name );
		assert( 0 );
	}

	// use pixel in palette[0] (normal view) as o/p pixel RGB
	for ( int j = 0; j < flat_sz; j++ ) {
		rgb_t rgb = rgb_from_palette( index_buff[j], PAL_DEFAULT );
		pixel_buff[j * 3] = rgb.r;
		pixel_buff[j * 3 + 1] = rgb.g;
		pixel_buff[j * 3 + 2] = rgb.b;
	}

	// write image file
	char fname[1024];
	sprintf( fname, "%s.png", curr_lump_name );
	ret = stbi_write_png( fname, 64, 64, 3, pixel_buff, 0 );
	assert( ret != 0 );</textarea>

	<p>
		I used <tt>alloca</tt> rather than <tt>malloc</tt> because it can allocate small
		amounts of memory on the stack that are freed when the function that called alloca ends. Kind of
		convenient dynamic scratch memory if under a MB or two.
	</p>

	<p>
		This wrote out almost all of the simple images - well, all of the images that were 64x64
		pixels anyway. There are just a few exceptions. Sprites and images that can have
		transparent bits use a different format, which I'll come back to later.
		I won't display these here, because it's probably a bit naughty, but it indeed works.
	</p>

	<h3>Next Time</h3>

	<p>
		Next time I'll show you the bizarre hurdles I went through to crack into the music
		and sounds - which are in a proprietary format that was never documented anywhere.
		I got it working, of course. Then - ladies and gentlemen, I will show you how I
		rendered the maps in OpenGL.
