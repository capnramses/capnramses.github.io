	<h3>The Case of the Missing Triangles</h3>

	<p>
		I did a bit of poking around to find out why my IFC-to-custom-format conversion
		was missing triangles. I suspected that some were still quads. I imported the
		IFC into Blender, triangulated it, and exported in Wavefront .obj and I still
		had the same problem. Curious!
	</p>

	<div class="centre">

		<small><i>My converter successfully converted an IFC mesh that my viewer could
				draw in OpenGL 4, but some bits were missing.</i></small>
	</div>

	<p>
		I used my converter's post-processing tools to clean up the mesh, but this
		didn't work very well, and introduced some additional errors.
		On closer investigation the files were fragmented into a very high number of
		separate 'sub-meshes'. These didn't seem to follow any sensible order; one
		would presume that the cars would be a sub-mesh, the roof another, etc. I
		suspect that the IFC 'classes' (templates) are represented as separate 'objects'
		in 3d graphics jargon (an object is a sub-mesh). Probably the converter couldn't
		deal with merging hundreds and hundreds of objects together. It's absolutely
		not efficient to separate a mesh into sub-meshes for drawing because it doesn't
		make use of the parallelism of modern graphics hardware. I was only using one
		drawing operation - one sub-mesh drawn, so it was more than likely missing some
		of the extra pieces if they weren't religiously put into the same hierarchy of
		IFC classes.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/ifcview2.png" /><br />
		<small><i>Manually cleaning up the mesh in Blender, and joining all of the
				vertex groups/sub-meshes together solved the missing triangles problem.</i>
		</small>
	</div>

	<p>
		I imported the IFC into Blender and manually 'cleaned up' the mesh. There were
		thousands of repeated (redundant) vertices that I stripped away. I also
		'joined' all of the objects/classes/sub-meshes into a single mesh with no
		hierarchy anything. I forcibly triangulated the entire mesh, recalculated the
		normals to all face outwards, and applied various small optimisations. This
		seemed to fix the main problem, as pictured above. There are some holes in it
		though (between floors, for example). Either some objects were left out, or
		the polygons are in a reverse order to the rest, and the viewer thinks that
		they are facing the other way, and would be visible from inside the house.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/ifcview2_nocull.png" /><br />
		<small><i>
				Finally - the entire mesh drawn! I had to disable back-face culling. This shows
				that some of the polygons are erroneously defined in back-to-front 'winding'
				order, opposite to the convention used in the rest of the mesh.
			</i>
		</small>
	</div>

	<p>
		I disabled 'back-face culling' so that forward and backward-facing polygons
		were all drawn. This is very in-efficient to draw, but shows that yes, indeed,
		some of the polygons from the IFC are defined in an inconsistent order to the
		rest! This could be because some of the non-triangular polygons were incorrectly
		triangulated, but I doubt it.

	<h3>Criticism of IFC File Size</h3>

	<table>
		<tr>
			<td><b>File Format</b></td>
			<td>File Size (kB)</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>.ifc</td>
			<td>14600</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>.obj</td>
			<td>1400</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>.apg</td>
			<td>3400</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

	<p>
		The above table gives a comparison of file sizes for the same sample IFC mesh
		that <u>only contains geometry for drawing</u>. Firstly, the original file in
		IFC format was a gigantic 14.6 MB. This is really too large to use as an
		interchange format over the web. The exact same geometry in a face-indexed
		Wavefront .obj file is only 1.4 MB, and in my custom non-index format it is
		still only 3.4 MB. Why is the IFC file an order of magnitude larger? My own
		format is already excessively verbose for the purpose of readability and
		debugging, and has no optimisation at all.

	<p>
		I did a quick analysis of the test file.
		A sample of the critical part of the file is above.
		Although it is better suited for
		C-style <tt>fscanf</tt> parsing than XML-based formats, it still has some
		irritations around variable numbers of, or optional attributes. Ignoring that
		small issue, some more important observations of weak points in the format:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Glut of useless header information and meta-data.</li>
		<li>Excessively verbose titles for each and every data point.</li>
		<li>Superfluous line numbers on every line.</li>
		<li>Unnecessary operators, brackets, and semi-colons on every line.</li>
		<li>Meta-data that can be quickly derived from the data itself.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Basically, the main failing is that the amount of bytes used to represent a
		single data point is far too high. In IFC a point itself (just the
		XYZ value) occupies about 50 bytes of data. I would argue that the precision
		used is probably too high,
		far beyond the actual accuracy of the data, which is misleading. We want to
		use <tt>float</tt> to represent data for drawing, and this can only be
		guaranteed to support 8 s.f. Do we really have measurements of the building
		down to 10^-17 of a meter? I don't think so! The wood used in the building will
		warp above the mm range. These values could probably be about 20 bytes.
		Regardless, the main problem is that every data
		point comes with <u>another 90 bytes of data saying that it is a data point</u>.
		This could easily be addressed by having a single line appear before all the
		points that says something to the tune of "2000 3d points follow this line".
	</p>

	<p>
		Now, this is only for a trivial example file. For a larger building that
		<u>also</u> includes other types of system that are not for graphical display
		we have something that takes several minutes to parse, and is far too big to
		be requested over the web (my primary use-case). I'm disappointed that it's
		still too intricate to reliably build an automatic converter for. I still had
		to do a significant amount of by-eye manual clean-up before it was ready for
		conversion to another format. My gut feeling is that using a complex format
		like this that allows bad geometric design is not a good idea. It's not good
		for interchange over the web, or for any sort of drawing, and I don't see good
		reasons for this - it's just not efficiently designed. I think it would be
		better to get the users of CAD design software to understand <u>why</u> a mesh
		should be designed a certain way for efficient rendering. It's no longer really
		appropriate for a designer to not know how modern 3d graphics hardware works
		when there are so many interesting, and incredibly useful run-on applications
		of visualising these building plans in 3d.
