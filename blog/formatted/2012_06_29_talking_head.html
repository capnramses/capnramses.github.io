	<h3>Talking Head Weighted Average</h3>
	<p>
		After doing some reading about complicated interpolation methods for morph target animations, I thought "Ah for
		goodness sake - this is going nowhere!" and wrote a very simple weighted average function. That fixed it. I had 2
		targets as well as a kind of default shape that I was unconsciously intending to show up as the sum of the other
		targets was < 1.0. This was my hitch. I threw in a little <tt>clamp</tt> function to turn this into a sensible
			value, and tested it in my very handy <a href="https://antongerdelan.net/demos/editshaders/">shader editing
				demo</a>. That worked:

	<small><b>Generic GLSL code</b></small>
	<form>
		<textarea rows="10" cols="69">
// total of factors
float totalfactors = morphtimefactor + madfactor;
float defaultfacefactor = 1.0 - totalfactors;
defaultfacefactor = clamp (defaultfacefactor, 0.0, 1.0);
totalfactors = totalfactors + defaultfacefactor;
float smilefactor = morphtimefactor / totalfactors;
float angryfactor = madfactor / totalfactors;
vec3 localPos = mix (lc_vp, mad_loc, smilefactor);
localPos = mix (localPos, mtarget_loc, angryfactor);
</textarea>
	</form>

	<p>I updated my <a href="https://antongerdelan.net/demos/talkinghead/">talking head demo</a> with the new shader.</p>

	<h3>3D Picking with Rays</h3>

	<p>
		I want to implement a few different 3D picking algorithms and try them all; at least ray-casting based and
		colour-picking methods.
		I just finished coding up my 3D picking algorithm from the earlier journal entry. It seems to be working in my
		off-line test programme.
		Once again, a lot of misleading half-knowledge on the web, and lots of out-dated OpenGL 2.1 information that no
		longer applies.
		This <a href="http://www.opengl.org/archives/resources/faq/technical/selection.htm#sele0010">older info</a> was a
		handy reference to make sure that I was on the right track (the first part anyway).
		Need to try it in a 3D programme now;
	</p>

	<small><b>C code using the glm maths library</b></small>
	<form>
		<textarea rows="10" cols="88">
// convert 2D coords into clip space. remembering that y should be negated from up->down to down->up
float mousex_cli = mousex_px / viewwidth_px * 2.0f - 1.0f;
float mousey_cli = -(mousey_px / viewheight_px * 2.0f - 1.0f);

// create 3D ray in eye space
// (on near clip plane so clip z = 0
// x and y are not altered between clip z=0 and eye.
// eye space z is just the distance from 0 to near clip plane) 
glm::vec3 ray_eye (mousex_cli, mousey_cli, -gCam.mNearClip);

// convert ray to world coords
glm::vec4 ray_wor = glm::inverse (gCam.mViewMat) * glm::vec4 (ray_eye.x, ray_eye.y, ray_eye.z, 0.0f);
ray_wor = glm::normalize (ray_wor);

// seems to work!
</textarea>
	</form>

	<p>
		The next step is to add in the ray vs sphere code to see if I can click on things. I plan to debug this part
		visually, so I have been building a function to display a renderable's bounding sphere as a semi-transparent mesh.
		If I can check against the bounding spheres with the ray, then perhaps change their colour when a hit is detected,
		it should be pretty easy to verify if the code is working properly and not giving false positives or false
		negatives.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/boundingspheres.png" width="512" /><br />
		<small><i>I plan to render these blue spheres around each object. They are of unit size, so I should be able to
				scale each one based on the greatest (absolute) x, y, or z position value from each object's origin. If the
				spheres are too big and clumsy versus the shape and proximity of the objects, then we can also tell if we need a
				more precise algorithm</i></small>
	</div>

	<h3>Next Week</h3>

	<p>I plan to get the 3D ray picking working with spheres, then implement a colour-based picking algorithm and compare
		the results. I'll get them both working in WebGL as well.</p>
