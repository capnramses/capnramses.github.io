	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>OpenGL Renderbuffer vs. Depth Texture Attachment</h2>

	<p>
		If you want to do any multi-pass rendering or post processing technique in
		OpenGL you need to set up a secondary <tt>framebuffer</tt>. Your first pass
		renders the normal 3d scene to the framebuffer, where you typically store the
		fragment output in a colour texture that fits your viewport. In a subsequent
		pass you might add a blur or some image processing thing. Using the default
		framebuffer (the one normally in use) you render a quad covering the screen and
		sample the texture from the first pass.
	</p>

	<p>
		In order to make sure that you still have <b>depth testing</b> (so that farther
		away things aren't drawn over the top of closer things) in your secondary
		framebuffer you need to attach an additional depth buffer to it because it's no
		longer using the default depth buffer. There are 2 apprarent options for this
		in OpenGL:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>Attach something called a <tt>renderbuffer</tt> to the framebuffer</li>
		<li>Attach a normal OpenGL <tt>texture</tt> with its format set to
			<tt>GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT</tt> or some specific 16/24/32-bit version of that.</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		The OpenGL <a href="http://www.opengl.org/wiki/Renderbuffer_Object">wiki suggests</a>
		using the texture when you need to sample the depth
		values later on (such as in shadow mapping), and using the Renderbuffer for
		everything else. I think David Wolff's book does this too from memory...anyway
		I always thought "renderbuffer" was a bit odd-sounding for something that was
		basically a depth buffer, and frankly I spend most of my time with students
		explaining the weird naming conventions of GL, so I asked <a
			href="https://twitter.com/capnramses/status/466500320990736384">
			about it on Twitter</a> this morning.
	</p>

	<p>
		Apparently the 'renderbuffer' name is a throw-back to support for an earlier
		implementation of MSAA (multi-sample anti-aliasing). As suggested I have tried
		it. I took a simple framebuffer switching demo
		<a href="https://antongerdelan.net/opengl/framebuffers.html">as described here</a>
		and put an <tt>if</tt> statement in to try both options, right after where I
		build my secondary framebuffer:

		I set up a scene with 2 spheres, one behind the other, to make sure that depth
		testing was working. I swapped the rendering order around to be sure - turns out
		I had forgotten to enable depth testing first...easy to fix!
	</p>

	<p>
		I expected the texture might be a bit slower but it wasn't - no big difference.
		In newer OpenGL - (4.2 I think?) You can use the generic texture storage functions
		instead which are a bit less verbose, so that's not really a big deal either.
		It's pretty much the same sort of thing, except that the name is less ambiguous
		than "renderbuffer" (what buffer isn't used in rendering?), and if you want to you can sample the texture later.
		Apparently 3.2 and newer can handle depth textures. I don't think WebGL has them
		yet - I recall doing something gross to store depths in a colour texture to get
		shadows working. What I would really prefer (to keep it simple) would be
		something like: <tt>glEnableDepthTesting (my_fbo, 32);</tt> and just not expose the
		messy bits at all. It would be trivial to write this for myself of course, but if it were
		like this to begin with <u>it would be easier to learn</u>.
