	<h3>Vertex Displacement Animation</h3>

	<p>
		I'm getting closer to plotting something clever from this 360 degree camera data. As an
		intermediary step (hitting 3 birds with one stone) I made of WebGL version of the vertex displacement animation
		that I'm using in OpenGL4. I uncovered lots of pain-in-the-butt parts of
		WebGL this time - had some problems with texture compression or internal format that was hard to
		figure out. It will go into the write-up. Anyway, it works well now and is easy to modify.
