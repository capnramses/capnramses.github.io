		<small><i>It's immediately obvious what one application of this algorithm is
				from my little test programme's output here, but it can also be used for
				determining things like line-of-sight paths through lattice-based environments
				with some limitations. I draw two separate lines here of thickness 3.</i></small>
	</div>

	<p>
		First of all, the Wikipedia article for this algorithm, like all Wikipedia
		articles for mathematics, is unreadable rubbish. The nicest article is at this
		website: <a
			href="http://www.falloutsoftware.com/tutorials/dd/dd4.htm">http://www.falloutsoftware.com/tutorials/dd/dd4.htm</a>,
		where I find the listing there to be the most robust and general to different
		line types also. I re-implement a version of that here and explain my
		understanding.
	</p>

	<p>
		Bresenham's algorithm is a nice way to interpolate a line of pixels between any
		two 2d points. Nice because it's fast. You don't need to check every pixel in
		each column of the image for its distance from the line equation at a given x
		or something to find which pixels to colour. The general idea is:
	</p>

	<ol>
		<li>
			The line to draw is defined by two image locations (start and end x and y in
			pixels).
		</li>
		<li>
			Work out which is the "major" axis - i.e. is the line mostly changing in either
			x, or y axis.
		</li>
		<li>
			An "error" value is initialised to <u>double</u> the distance |end-start| along
			the major axis minus the distance |end-start| along the minor axis.
		</li>
		<li>
			Step (loop) along the major axis, one pixel at a time, from the start to the
			end of the line.<br /><br />
			<ul>
				<li>
					We plot a pixel at the current x and y point (initialised to the start point).
				</li>
				<li>
					We add double the total line distance along the minor axis to the error value
					at every step.
				</li>
				<li>
					If the error value is positive we subtract double the total line distance
					along the major axis from the error accumulation, and we also increment the
					current minor-axis value by 1 in the direction of the slope e.g. y++ if the
					major axis is x, and the line is sloping positively in y.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>

	<p>
		The error accumulation is a bit odd. Basically what it does is factor the slope
		of the line into the decision whether to increment the minor-axis pixel or not
		for the next plot point. If we have a slope of 1 then we will get a positive
		error value at every step, and therefore the y value of the pixel will increase
		by 1 for every increase in x value; a 45 degree diagonal line. If we have a
		slope of 0.5 then the error value will only be positive in every second step. I
		feel like this could be expressed more naturally with a more traditional slope
		calculation evident.
	</p>

	<p>
		The reason that we use the curious 2 * distance values is because this lets us
		use integers for the entire algorithm. Otherwise we have to use floats, and
		deal with fractions in the loop.
	</p>

	<p>
		A limitation of this algorithm is that the line only ever has one pixel in the
		minor axis for
		any major-axis value. That's okay, but sometimes the mathematical line would
		cut through two pixel's boxes within one major-axis pixel
		width. In this case it might make sense to colour both pixels, rather than just
		the closest one - especially if we are calculating the line for collision
		detection or something, rather than just drawing a simple line.
	</p>

	<p>
		Another limitation is that the line is only ever one pixel thick, and there is
		no anti-aliasing. I easily added a thickness to the line by plotting extra
		points adjacent to the centre pixel at each plot location - this adds basically
		no extra computational cost to the algorithm. Anti-aliasing can easily be added
		in as a post-process or even by making the thickness-plots a half-way colour.
	</p>

	<h3>Listing: My First Implementation of the Algorithm</h3>

	<p>
		I used C and Sean Barrett's stb_image_write.h library to write to a PNG.
		There's no particular need for this though - the memory can be dumped directly,
		as-is to a binary file and converted at the command line from raw format with
		ImageMagick or a similar tool, or copied directly into an OpenGL texture or
		something like that for interactive rendering.
	</p>

Bresenham's Algorithm, Jack Bresenham 1962.
Definition:
An efficient algorithm to render a line with pixels. The long dimension is
incremented for each pixel, and the fractional slope is accumulated.
