	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>Website Migration Project</h2>

	<p>
		My current website is based on a Godaddy host. It's over-priced, painful to
		maintain, and keeps getting hacked into. I'd like to stop paying them, but the
		effort to migrate over has stopped me...but I think it's time.
	</p>

	<p>
		I'm interested in moving to a static site hosted from a GitHub (or similar)
		repository because it's more convenient to edit and I like the open format. The
		downside is that my blog is a homemade bit of PHP and I'd be sorry to lose that
		little project. Everyone is talking about Hugo blogs lately, so I might give
		that a go. It would be okay for the blog to be offline for a while too.
	</p>

	<p>
		In any case, I think that will be an October 2016 project, and will give me a
		chance to tidy up some bits and pieces too (I have a list of errors on my OpenGL
		pages that need fixing).
	</p>

	<p>
		I'll probably stop paying for my @antongerdelan.net emails too - I've had
		everything filtering into a gmail account for a while because it was also
		painful to use. This might break a few things that still use the older address...
		I think I'll still keep the antongerdelan.net site though - perhaps there's a
		pithier address I can grab for next time.
