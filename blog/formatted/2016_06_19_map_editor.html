	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>How the Map Editor Works in Crongdor</h2>

	<p>
		I'm going to describe the basics of how to use the map editor that I included
		with <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/467790/">Crongdor the Barbarian</a>, as well as some background
		about how the map
		format was designed.
	</p>

	<h3>It Started With Plain Text Files</h3>

	<p>
		My original design for the game was all based on a 2d board of square tiles
		(like checkers) that could be raised or lowered to different heights. This
		meant that I could express the world in discrete 2d coordinates - like the game
		Battleship, or how chess moves are described. But, most importantly, it meant
		that I could store a map in a text file, where each character described a
		tile's height:
	</p>

	<pre>
12345678
11111111
11111111
11111111
</pre>

	<p>
		If each character represents the height of a tile, and we say that each level
		is perhaps 2 units or 2 meters apart, then we have something like a chunky
		staircase
		of tiles in the top of this map. So, originally, I just used a text editor to
		design my maps. This is pretty common actually - a lot of 2d games will use a
		similar method, usually preferring to store each tile's information as a
		different coloured pixel in an image file and then editing the map in a paint
		program - same idea. Eventually, as you add complexity to your game, it becomes a little
		frustrating to work this way. The time/benefit scale tips to making it worth
		writing a full-scale "what you see is what you get" (WYSIWYG) editor.
	</p>

	<p>
		The quickest route to a WYSIWYG editor was to re-use the existing game code
		that already loaded all the necessary props and characters, and displayed the
		map. I just copied Crongdor's <tt>main.cpp</tt> file into a slightly different
		version called <tt>editor.cpp</tt> that had different controls
		for editing, and commented out the lines that update the character movement,
		and so on. It would also have been possible to build a "live" editor into the
		game, so it went into edit mode when you press F2 or something - like the
		<a href="http://sauerbraten.org/">Sauerbraten</a> engines. I decided to keep
		live game code as uncluttered as possible, because you'll see that there
		are many things that creep in to clutter your code, and it becomes harder to
		keep it all spinning in your short-term memory, and harder to debug. So, my
		editor is really just a rebuild of the main game, switching <tt>main.cpp</tt>
		with <tt>editor.cpp</tt>, which you can see if you look at the
		<tt>Makefile</tt> in the source bundle.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/map_editor_0.png" /><br />
		<small><i>A section of <tt>e1m1.map</tt> in a text editor.</i></small>
	</div>

	<p>
		You can still hand-edit the map files, and that might be useful for some more
		subtle tweaks. The maps are stored in the <tt>maps/</tt> folder and can be
		opened with any plain text editor - don't use a "rich text" editor, it'll mess
		up the formatting. Just be careful, some sections start with a "count" of how
		many items are in the section (number of props etc.), which you will have to
		manually update.
	</p>

	<h3>Starting the Editor</h3>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/map_editor_1.png" /><br />
		<small><i>The "Empty_..." maps are blank templates in 2 different sizes.</i></small>
	</div>

	<p>
		The first thing you'll see is this dialogue that asks you to load an existing
		map. This is everything listed in the <tt>editor/maps.txt</tt> file. "E1M1" is
		a quick copy of the first map in Doom that I made as an amusing example. You
		can load this to see how the different game elements work, or just start from
		scratch. The 32x32 tile size is suitable for most levels - the 64x64 size
		starts to get very hard to survive all the way to the end of the map! Scroll
		down and hit enter. I'll start on a blank map.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/map_editor_4.png" /><br />
		<small><i>The map editor is split into modes and has very simple key controls.
				The green sprite shows you the 'current' tile that you'll edit.</i></small>
	</div>

	<p>
		I don't like complex menu systems, and I didn't want to link in another library
		so everything is very minimal, and based on my existing text rendering
		functionality. I removed the mouse integration fairly early on to simplify
		everything. There's a hint in the bottom left that you can press <b>H</b> to
		list all the commands. Just about everything is listed there. The editor is
		split into modes so that the basic controls are re-used. The top-right
		colour-coded tab tells you which mode the editor is currently in;
		tiles/props/characters/triggers/sounds. I originally used the F-keys to switch
		modes but my Apple-using friends complained, so I switched to the number-key
		row!
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/map_editor_5.png" /><br />
		<small><i>In "tiles" mode W/S raise and lower tiles and X changes type.</i></small>
	</div>

	<h3>Editing Tiles</h3>

	<p>
		Okay, so you start in Tiles editing mode - let's edit some tiles! You can move
		the camera around with the arrow <b>cursor keys</b>. <b>Pgup/Pgdn</b> fly up
		and down. The green sprite shows you the 'current' tile that you'll edit, and
		this moves around under the camera in the centre of the view. You've probably
		already discovered that <b>W</b> and <b>S</b> raise and lower the tiles. You
		can also toggle a tile's "type" between flat/stairs/water with <b>X</b>. If
		some gaps appear bewteen walls - don't worry - the editor treats each tile as
		a separate mesh that it builds, but when the map is loaded whole regions are
		built into single manifolds (or "chunks") of tiles, so these gaps will be
		plugged.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/map_editor_6.png" /><br />
		<small><i>Each tile can be painted with a set of 4 textures for top and sides.</i></small>
	</div>

	<p>
		If you press <b>return/enter</b> you get a texture chooser. This is actually
		one big texture atlas called a "palette", sub-divided into 8x8 sub-images. Each
		2x2 region is a set of 4 images that texture a particular tile. In this way the
		tiles have separate top and side textures, without you needing to specify each
		individually. Find an interesting texture and press <b>return</b> again to
		select it. If you press <b>space bar</b> it will paint the current tile with
		your texture. You can hold down space and move the camera around to paint a
		snake of tiles in one go.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/map_editor_7.png" /><br />
		<small><i>Each tile can be painted with a set of 4 textures for top and sides.</i></small>
	</div>

	<p>
		You can switch to a different palette texture set - maybe you'll decide to make
		your own textures. Press <b>esc</b> to open the main menu and try switching to
		my copy of Doom's textures. It's called "Boom". There are actually 2 texture
		images named for each palette - a diffuse map (basic colours), and a
		specular/emissive map (shiny surfaces, with lights stored in the alpha channel).
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/map_editor_8.png" /><br />
		<small><i>You can have a different set of textures for different maps, as shown
				here by switching to my terrible copy of Doom's textures!</i></small>
	</div>

	<h3>Editing Props</h3>

	<p>
		If you press the <b>2</b> number row key you'll go into Props editing mode.
		The controls are the same. This time press <b>return</b> to bring up a list of
		props to place down. Press <b>space</b> to place a prop in the world. You can
		rotate props with the <b>A,D</b> keys. In this way you might squeeze several
		"amphora" props into a single tile. You can also move them up and down
		different height levels, which suits things like the "dungeon bridge" prop,
		which you may not see after you place it down, as it starts a little below the
		lip of a tile so that it doesn't cast odd shadows on neighbouring tiles. You
		can delete a prop, when in Props mode, with the <b>DEL</b> key.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/map_editor_9.png" /><br />
		<small><i>Props are pretty easy to place down. You can also rotate them around
				to look a little less uniform.</i></small>
	</div>

	<p>
		The "monolith interior" prop is the end-of-level portal, with
		"monolith exterior" being the cosmetic prop that surrounds it. It comes as 2
		different props, because the interior bit with the wobbly animation uses a
		different shader set, and I simplify each prop so that each can only have one
		shader set.
	</p>

	<h3>Editing Characters</h3>

	<p>
		Press <b>3</b> to go into character editing mode.
		Characters work exactly the same way as props. They only caveat is that there
		should only be one Crongdor character, and it should be the first character in
		the list, which is why he starts in the empty map template. If you delete him
		and another character is the first in the list...well, try it later!
	</p>

	<h3>Editing Triggers</h3>

	<p>
		Press <b>4</b> to go into character editing mode.
		Some of the things in the game transmit a signal when they are "triggered";
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>tripwires only trigger once</li>
		<li>touchplates trigger repeatedly but hard to spot</li>
		<li>windlasses (winches) - trigger once, easy to see</li>
		<li>diamonds (floating green narrative hint things)</li>
		<li>killing special characters - have names ending in "_tx"</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		In Triggers mode, if you hover the cursor over these props you'll see a purple
		dialogue show, for example, "<b>WINDLASS</b> TX: -1". This means that my
		windlass prop can transmit a code. Right now it's set to -1, which means
		"ignore". If you hover over it and press <b>W,S</b> you can change its code.
		0 or higher is a valid code. I'll set it to 0. Now, you've probably guessed,
		that anything that I set down in the map that can receive a code can be set
		up with a matching code number. Receivers include:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>doors</li>
		<li>boulder traps</li>
		<li>dart traps</li>
		<li>various "lift/elevator" platforms</li>
		<li>comic text pop-ups</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		You can have more than one thing trigger the same code, and more than one
		thing receive that code. I thought about "AND" and "OR" types of props so that
		you could do stuff like have a door open, only if a specific combination of
		triggers are activated, but those kind of puzzles didn't really fit the fast-paced
		idea of the game.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/map_editor_10.png" /><br />
		<small><i>I added a trigger for my windlass (TX = 0) and a stone door that it opens with
				matching (RX = 0).</i></small>
	</div>

	<p>
		You can add and edit the pop-up narrative text boxes in the main menu <b>ESC</b>.
		This may be a little confusing, but you write a string of text, including the
		reciever code, and a code for an RGBA colour for the box. Multi-line text is
		separated by entering "\" followed by "n". The empty map templates come with
		some text already defined for various receiver codes. If you go to "edit pop-up
		texts" you'll see how the format works. This is probably something that's easier
		to tweak by hand-editing the map file.
	</p>

	<h3>Editing Ambient Sounds</h3>

	<p>
		If you hit number key <b>5</b> you can edit ambient sounds that you can hear at
		different places in the level. Once again press <b>return</b> to get a list of
		sounds that you can use. If you press <b>return</b> again you should get a
		preview played. Press <b>space</b> to place it somewhere in the map. You'll
		see a cube indicating the centre position of the sound emitter. Move the camera
		out and you'll see a sphere indicating its radius. The sounds are coded to
		have a linear roll-off, so you'll hear them at full volume when the camera is
		on the same spot as where you see the cube, and not at all outside the sphere.
		This should work in the editor too (WYHIWYG?). The ambient sounds are set to
		a fixed position over the terrain (as the camera is in the game). In this
		case <b>W,S</b> do not move the sound up and down, but change the range of the
		sound - you'll see the sphere shrink and grow. Delete a sound with <b>DEL</b>.
	</p>

	<h3>Choosing Music</h3>

	<p>
		You can choose the music track in the main menu too. The "hammer track" is an
		additional music track to switch to when Crongdor picks up the maul (hammer) -
		I didn't use this in the final version because I went with the war drums, but I
		was going to switch to a Rock and Roll track at this point. The functionality
		is still there if you feel inspired. I'll go over adding custom assets like
		music to the game in a later post.
	</p>

	<h3>Saving Your Map</h3>

	<p>
		The map editor probably still has some crash bugs in it - save your map often!
		You can do this in the main menu (<b>ESC</b>). Note that you don't get prompted
		to save when you go to quit, so you'll have to do that yourself.
	</p>

	<h3>Loading Your Map</h3>

	<p>
		Your map will be saved in the game's <tt>maps/</tt> folder with the rest of the
		maps. The editor will append your map to the list of maps to put in the
		"Custom Maps" menu in the game. This is the <tt>editor/maps.txt</tt> file,
		which you can hand-edit if you like. So, if you start the game, and go to the
		Custom Maps sub-menu, you should be able to launch it from there! It will have
		the default description and title, which I would hand-edit in the map file later.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/map_editor_12.png" /><br />
		<small><i>And it works! With all the lighting and shadows in the game.</i></small>
	</div>

	<h3>Final Touches</h3>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/map_editor_2.png" /><br />
		<small><i>You may find it easier to hand-edit text sections.</i></small>
	</div>

	<p>
		It's easier to edit things like the map story text by hand-editing the
		map in a text editor.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The first line in the file is the title of the map that appears in the
			map menu screen.</li>
		<li>The second line is the par time for the map.</li>
		<li>The next line must say how many lines of text the map story has.</li>
		<li>Then follows that many lines of map story text. There's no line-wrapping
			functionality, so you have to take a good guess about where to end each line.</li>
		<li>The next line is the music track to use for the map, or "0" for none.</li>
		<li>The line after that is the "hammer" track.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		You'll notice that the comic book font that I drew for the game doesn't have
		any lower-case letters. It has all-caps, and a bold version of each. I copied
		a comic-book caption style for the text pop-ups. This means that when you write
		lower-case it appears as upper-case in the font. I used upper-case to indicate
		that you want bold - that way I was able to just use the C language's default
		<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII">ASCII</a> functions for text. So, if your
		title is "The Tower of the Elephant", you'll need to write it as "the tower of
		the elephant", or it's going to look like "<b>T</b>he <b>T</b>ower of the <b>E</b>lephant"!
	</p>

	<h3>Questions?</h3>

	<p>
