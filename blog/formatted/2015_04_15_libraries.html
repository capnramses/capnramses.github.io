	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>Libraries</h2>

	<p>
		I've been working on my skill-base by making lots of little mini-libraries. The
		latest additions are the memory allocation wrapper, and
		data structures library, GLSL parser. I mentioned the interpolation work in the
		previous post. The other libraries are older and have been updated.

		The memory allocation wrapper was an experiment to see if I could wrap extant
		calls to built-in functions in a convenient way (answer=yes). I basically just
		created a linked list accounting for all memory allocations versus all freeing
		operations. A better solution would be to put these little accounting
		structures on the end of the actual blocks to reduce fragmentation, but I found
		this was vulnerable to segfaults - probably due to memory overflows somewhere
		in the code base I was testing, which is a separate issue. It did it's job well
		at reporting leaks, but I do an order O(n) search in each freeing operation,
		which would go away with the end-of-block idea which can be address-indexed.
	</p>

	<p>
		The data structures library for C99 was an attempt to help get rid of old STL
		vector reliance, which I would use when being lazy. These were introducing
		segfault bugs due to unsafe random item erasure, so it's better to have an
		on-hand linked list or dynamic array ready to go. Having a single point of
		failure and improvement seems like a good idea.
	</p>

	<p>
		I have had lingering issues with AJAX loading of shaders from files for WebGL,
		so my GLSL parser was an experiment to get around asynchronous issues by
		reading shaders from HTML5 script blocks instead of files, with some additional
		pre-processor features like support for #include from other scripts to make
		code re-use less of a pain (repeating changes to lighting algorithms for each
		shader in a project is a pain). I added additional error checking, and also
		supporting single-file splits for vertex and fragment shaders using
		<tt>#vert</tt> and <tt>#frag</tt> to indicate sub-sections.
	</p>

	<p>
		I made some clarifications to my mesh format. I feel that this should really be
		turned into a tech report or workshop paper, as it's a common question,
		especially for beginners, and is really quite simple and not well addressed
		anywhere.
	</p>

	<h2>Prototypes</h2>

	<p>
		I made <a href="https://antongerdelan.net/2015_03_20_page_icon_vis/">another mock-up</a> of a page of text with
		analytics for my visualisation
		project. WebGL was far superior to SVG, D3, and canvas2d in terms of
		performance, so I wanted to try a 2d vector graphics display with some nice
		bars, and some pointless but eye-catchy interpolated animations, using my
		library.

	<p>
		We're busy breaking down the linked data processes, with provenance, into a
		formalisation that might be easier to make into a nice visualisation tool.
