	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>Managing Code Projects Part One: Header Files</h2>

	<p>
		I'll write a few blog posts to share some experience about working on larger projects or coordinating with teams.
		I want to start out easy so here's a little aside about avoiding code tangles. Even projects that start off simple
		can quickly become quite complicated to follow as they grow, and as more people work on parts of them.
	</p>

	<h3>How Did This All Get So Tangled?</h3>

	<p>
		Structuring code in projects turns out to be one of the hardest things to learn how to do well. I mean it takes
		many years re-inventing the wheel and being exposed to the ideas of others before you start to get it right.
		Project structure is largely a problem about clearly communicating <b>with other people</b>.
		You'll often [read: almost always] work on older, and sometimes very old, codebases that are extremely difficult
		to follow. I'm talking about <b>LEGACY CODE</b>. I saw a great definition of this zip past on Twitter recently
		<i>"Legacy code is code you are afraid to change."</i>
		It's very easy to blame people who worked on code that is a mess, but that's not fair - there are good
		reasons why messy code exists, and it may be inevitable:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>The team was directed to rush to meet deadlines, and asked to skip due diligence on structure and iterations -
			this is almost certainly why.</li>
		<li>Programmers were catapulted, one at a time, into the project after it started, and it was already a mess by
			then. They did keyhole surgery,
			or wrote a layer/wrapper/interface to paint over the mould, then got out. Looking at these codebases can feel like
			examining the stratum layers of
			sediment deposits in an exposed cliff face. Comments can often be quite ... human. Nobody really had oversight of
			taking care of the whole of
			the project in a consistent way. Refactoring was left for a very, very rainy day.</li>
		<li>The programmers were not very experienced in working on long-running projects, didn't get needed senior
			oversight, or were just not familiar with that programming language.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		A real conundrum with contemporary software development is that software projects are never 'finished'.
		We do 'software as a service' or Agile continuous delivery. The requirements change frequently, which mean design
		must be flexible to change.
		But many of our tools and techniques were designed assuming the entire project had been fully specced out in
		advance.
		As an industry-standard OOP project evolves it quickly collapses into a birds nest of everything-includes-everything
		else.
		Eventually you reach a log-jam state where there is no nice way to structure things, and you either have to scrap
		it,
		spend a good deal of time and money re-thinking structure, or do what most programmers do, and just write in
		shortcuts/pointers/friend
		relationships to cross around their own object structure. Most people in tech don't actually work on a project, or
		at a company, for more
		than a year or two, so can conveniently avoid ever dealing with this and then move to the next start-up!
	</p>

	<h3>Reducing Relationships Between Files</h3>

	<p>
		A good principle to <b>keep your software flexible to change</b> - which is the key to longevity -
		is to reduce relationships between components - try to keep modules/classes/files/functions more or
		less stand-alone. I can talk about inheritance and composition later, but let's look at something
		simpler first: header files in C and C++.
	</p>

	<p>
		Header files are a language quirk, and understanding what to do with them for a practical purpose is a bit mixed.
		Here are common conventions:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><i>Java-ish style</i> - every class has a <tt>myclass.c</tt>, and a corresponding <tt>myclass.h</tt> for the
			interface and API documentation.</li>
		<li><i>C modules style</i> - groups of related functions or classes sit in a <tt>mymodule.c</tt>, and these have a
			<tt>mymodule.h</tt> for externally-visible function declarations and variables (again, the interface).</tt>
		<li><i>Curmudgeon style</i> - modules have a <tt>mymodule.c</tt> files. There is only one header file for all
			external declarations, and probably a rude comment at the top saying <i>"This header is only here because C/C++
				still requires header files in 2019"</i>.</li>
		<li><i>Typical industry shitshow</i> - there is absolutely no consistently followed convention. Headers include
			other headers that include other headers, that include the original headers.
			Tiny code compiles take forever. You lose your sanity trying to follow it. Function code is also in headers.
			Showing-off-my-skills templated classes creating complex inter-dependencies are everywhere.
			You can't change or tidy anything, because other, seemingly-unrelated, pieces fall off the other side of the
			project when you do.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Some sort of convention is useful to reduce the cognitive overhead of anyone working on the project. Pick any of the
		top three - they all have their merits. Add the following concepts - they will help immensely to keep things simple:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Header files do not include any other header files, except for <tt>stdint.h</tt> for C and C++ and
			<tt>stdbool.h</tt> for C.</li>
		<li>"But what about my custom types in <tt>graphics.h</tt>?" - create a <tt>types.h</tt> for your project, and put
			all the typedefs and structs used in your interfaces (in header files) in here.
			Your headers may include <tt>types.h</tt> in addition to the above.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		You'll find that this will significantly reduce the complexity of growing projects. Try to stick to a single
		<tt>types.h</tt> file as long as you can, rather than one per module, or it will be more difficult to manage.
		If you could draw a diagram of relationships between files it would be quite a lot simpler now, yes?
		If you're just using a single header file for everything then this isn't a concern,
		but I don't think that's everyone's favourite on team projects. I think you can drop most developer guidelines or
		rules, but this keep-the-headers-stand-alone one should be helpful to keep and gently enforce.
	</p>

	<p>
		You can take this principle further and work towards most <tt>.c</tt> files being able to compile on their own with
		no or minimal header includes. Try adding a <tt>main()</tt> to the bottom
		of the file and calling some of your functions. Then you'll also find it easy to reason about the logic, especially
		from a unit testing point of view, since it's all in one place: data in, logic, data out.
	</p>
