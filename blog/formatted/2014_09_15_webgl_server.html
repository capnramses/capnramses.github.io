	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>WebGL-Server Experiment</h2>

	<p>
		I've been curious since the beginning about using WebGL with a server. I got
		stuck on CPU-intensive scene management techniques with JavaScript - they get
		bogged down, where a native C programme blazes through. So, I guess just using
		WebGL in-browser for a viewer/visualiser only, and using an external server
		for crunching has always been on my mind.
	</p>

	<p>
		The other thought is coordinating multi-user view/input WebGL software. What is
		the best way to effect communication? I suspect running an external server is
		the best option again. I've never attempted any serious socket programming
		with JavaScript. I suspect there might be some easy-to-use frameworks for this.
	</p>

	<p>
		Things to investigate:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Is Node.js a good server-side tool for this task? Does it provide any
			easy-to-use socket abstractions that work well with client-side JS?</li>
		<li>Is it better to make a traditional C-based Unix server programme? Is it
			difficult to use JS as a client to this?</li>
		<li>What is the best way to handle secure communication?</li>
		<li>What is the best way to set up a user log-in system?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		To play with these things I'm starting yet another game-like side-project.

	<h2>Graphics Teaching</h2>

	<p>
		Teaching starts this coming Monday.
	</p>

	<h2>Book Chapters</h2>

	<p>
		Might need to increase my time on this to get a next publication out.
	</p>

	<h2>OpenGL Book Formats</h2>

	<p>
		I still haven't gotten around to re-formatting my e-book for other sites!
