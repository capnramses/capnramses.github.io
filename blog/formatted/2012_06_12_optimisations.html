	<h3>Optimisations and Uniforms</h3>
	<p>
		Profiling JS and WebGL is almost impossible. I went back to OpenGL and C
		to try some optimisations that I think will work inside the browser as
		well. Profiling showed me that I was wasting the majority of my CPU time
		on two things:
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Sending uniform variables from the CPU to the GPU.
		</li>
		<li>
			Constructing 3D vector objects.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		The first problem was a two-step fix. First, I was updating <b>all</b>
		of my uniform variables, every time that I rendered an object. This is
		not necessary, because uniforms are particular to shader programmes, not
		to vertex buffers. Many of the objects to be rendered will re-use the
		same shader programme. I sprinkled a few boolean flags around so that
		uniforms were only sent using <tt>glUniform...</tt> when the shader
		programme being used had changed, or the values in the uniforms needed
		to be changed. My objects are loaded in clumps, so I can be fairly
		confident that those using the same shader will all pop up in contiguous
		order in my rendering loop.
	</p>
	<p>
		The second problem was not made clear anywhere, and I just discovered it
		by profiling. Each call to <tt>glUniform</tt> requires that
		you give it the 'location' of the uniform variables in the
		shader programme. This is just an unique unsigned integer
		identifier. I was getting these, by name (by string),
		immediately before each call to set the uniform. But, as I
		discover, <b>Getting uniform locations during the main loop is incredibly
			slow</b>. I changed my engine to fetch all of these in the loading
		phase.
	</p>
	<p>
		<orange>The result of these uniform changes? 150% faster rendering
			rate.</orange>
	</p>
	<p>
		The other problem relates to 3D vector objects. The constructor for
		GLM's <tt>vec3</tt> was sucking up a huge chunk of my CPU time. Why? I
		wasn't using vec3s throughout the code-base, and had to make lots of
		conversions. Even so, it seemed like a trivial constructor, so I was
		surprised. Rather than give up on GLM, I just used vec3 whereever
		humanly possible, and passed vec3s by reference in every function
		parameter rather than re-assembling objects. INSERT POST HERE
		- it looks like this problem is considerably worse in Javascript.
	</p>
	<p>And the result of these few, seeminly minor, improvements? My OpenGL
		engine runs <orange>more than 2x faster</oranage>. The rendering alone
			has gone from a humble 30Hz to a fantastic 80Hz!</p>

	<h3>Future Optimisations</h3>
	<p>
		More event-driven engines are key I think. Making clever use of
		callbacks might be nice. With larger engines I suspect that a lot of my
		time is wasted cycling through loops that check if things should be on
		screen or not. Often they are not, which is a great saving for the GPU, but checking
		the entire list of renderables every frame is not ideal for the CPU. I think it's time to try
		managing separate lists of "visible" and "invisible" objects to reduce
		the length of loops.
	</p>
