	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>Writing a Blender Export Plug-In</h2>

	<p>
		Today I'm investigating how difficult it is to write a mesh export plug-in for
		Blender3D in Python. A previous observation is that Blender3D plug-ins are very
		unlikely to actually work with slightly newer releases/versions of the Blender
		software. I'm keeping this in mind as I read instructions, as I expect a lot of
		interface stuff to vary a bit from the instructions when I actually go to write
		it. Opening a few extant plug-in scripts makes them look fairly simple, and
		oddly enough the Blender data structures look quite simple and sensible. It
		would be great to be able to go directly from Blender to my new custom format
		(previous post) without relying on a file conversion stage. The down-side to
		this route is that I'll probably need to maintain a Blender script in different
		versions, as well as potentially a Max or Maya export script. Anyway, I'll jot
		stuff down here as I give it a go.
	</p>

	<h3>Found a Tutorial to Follow</h3>

	<p>
		I found a nice step-by-step guide to building an .obj exporter at
		<a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Advanced_Tutorials/Python_Scripting/Export_scripts">
			http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Blender_3D:_Noob_to_Pro/Advanced_Tutorials/Python_Scripting/Export_scripts</a>.
		I'll try to walk through this first.
	</p>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/pyconsole.png" /><br />
		<small><i>The Blender Python console. There is no <tt>faces</tt> variable, but
				there is a <tt>polygons</tt>.</i></small>
	</div>

	<p>
		Blender has a built-in Python console for interactively querying stuff that's in
		your current scene in Blender, in the same way as the final export script will
		do. That's pretty cool. Now, I'm using Blender 2.65 at work (and I think an
		even newer version at home). I notice straight away that if I query the contents
		of my mesh that there is no <tt>faces</tt>. There is a <tt>polygons</tt> though,
		and that looks about right - there's 6 of them, and my test cube should have 6
		square faces.
	</p>

	<h3>Writing a Script File</h3>

	<p>
		Okay, next difference to documentation (which I think was for version 2.5 or so)
		- the path where scripts should go. The tutorial said <tt>~/.blender/scripts</tt>
		which seems sane, but that didn't seem to work. Other scripts are reported as
		being in <tt>~/.config/blender/2.65/scripts/addons/</tt>. I got lost in the
		menu system, and I just couldn't find the button to "update menus", so I gave
		up and just closed and re-opened the programme. Maybe it's done dynamically now?
		Anyway, it didn't show up when I put it in the new folder either, so I guess
		some script spec has changed. Let's open up another one...
	</p>

	<p>
		It looks like the entire descriptor format has changed. It needs a <tt>bl_info</tt>
		block now instead, according to <a
			href="http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Dev:2.5/Py/Scripts/Guidelines/Addons">http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Dev:2.5/Py/Scripts/Guidelines/Addons</a>
		it should look like this:
	</p>

	<textarea rows=11>
bl_info = {
    "name": "My Script",
    "description": "Single line explaining what this script exactly does.",
    "author": "John Doe, Jane Doe",
    "version": (1, 0),
    "blender": (2, 65, 0),
    "location": "View3D > Add > Mesh",
    "warning": "", # used for warning icon and text in addons panel
    "wiki_url": "http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Extensions:2.5/Py/"
                "Scripts/My_Script",
    "category": "Add Mesh"}</textarea>

	<div class="centre">
		<img src="../images/addonsmenu.png" /><br />
		<small><i>Imagine my elation when this appeared in the Addons menu! Okay it
				wasn't that exciting.</i></small>
	</div>

	<p>
		...and it appears in the User Preferences&rarr;Addons menu! I can't enable it
		though - the BASH console says:
	</p>

	<textarea rows=4>
  File "/home/anton/.config/blender/2.65/scripts/addons/io_apg.py", line 26
    for ob in sce.objects
                        ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax</textarea>

	<p>
		So I went into the interactive console and fooled around. There was a
		<tt>bpy.data.scenes</tt>, but not a <tt>bpy.data.scenes.active</tt>. There
		didn't appear to be any objects in the scene - perhaps just iterating over
		<tt>bpy.data.objects</tt> is fine. This seems to work, taking care to mind
		Python's meaningful whitespace:
	</p>

	<textarea rows=5>
def write (filename):
	out = open (filename, "w")
	for ob in bpy.data.objects
		out.write (ob.type + ": " + ob.name + "\n");
	out.close ()</textarea>

	<p>
		Okay, it looks like the Blender interface in that tutorial is different to the
		2.65 version (COMPLTELY different); <a
			href="http://www.blender.org/documentation/blender_python_api_2_64_release/info_quickstart.html#integration">
			http://www.blender.org/documentation/blender_python_api_2_64_release/info_quickstart.html#integration</a>.
		I'll need some sort of class interface with register and unregister thingies.
	</p>

	<p>
		I followed that tutorial instead - it works! Not only did i find the secret
		script interface, but I notice that there's like 3 different terminals; the
		"what is the script runner doing" terminal up the top of the scripts view, the
		interactive console down the bottom, and the actual print out stream, which
		goes to the BASH console window from which you ran Blender. Yup.
	</p>

	<p>
		I opened up the STL format exporter script, and copied the layout. I notice that
		the main "init" Python script pulls in 2 additional utils scripts which are in
		the same folder. I would like to put everything into one file. I copied the STL
		plugin layout, deleted all the "import" functionality (I just want to export to
		start off with), removed hooks to external files, and renamed all the STL bits
		to APG. It now looks like this:
	</p>

bl_info = {
	"name": "Export .apg",
	"description": "Export mesh to Anton's custom script format (.apg)",

	"location": "File > Export > Anton's Skinned Mesh (.apg)",

if "bpy" in locals():
	import imp

import os

import bpy
from bpy.props import StringProperty, BoolProperty, CollectionProperty
from bpy_extras.io_utils import ExportHelper
from bpy.types import Operator, OperatorFileListElement

class ExportAPG(Operator, ExportHelper):
	bl_idname = "export_mesh.apg"
	bl_label = "Export APG"

	filename_ext = ".apg"
	filter_glob = StringProperty (default="*.apg", options={'HIDDEN'})

	def execute(self, context):
		import itertools
		faces = itertools.chain.from_iterable (
			blender_utils.faces_from_mesh (ob)
			for ob in context.selected_objects)
		write_apg (self.filepath, faces)
		
		return {'FINISHED'}

def menu_export (self, context):
	default_path = os.path.splitext (bpy.data.filepath)[0] + ".apg"
	self.layout.operator (ExportAPG.bl_idname, text="Anton's Format (.apg)")

def unregister():
	bpy.utils.unregister_module (__name__)
	bpy.types.INFO_MT_file_export.remove (menu_export)

if __name__ == "__main__":
	register()</textarea>

	<p>
		And it works! I can now click the tick-box to add the add-on to Blender, and it
		appears in the export scripts menu! I can even choose a filename to export. It
		won't work yet because my <tt>write_apg()</tt> function isn't defined yet. If I
		try to export a pop-up tells me this too, which is nice. I think I can write
		this function inside the export class there.

	</div>

	<h3>I Got a File Written Out!</h3>

	<p>
		For a cube I managed to get a file written out. I swiped the STL exporter's
		function that gets a list of faces for an object. It also triangulates a mesh
		which is nice. For a cube I got 36 3d vertex points written, which is exactly
		what I want; duplicated points and all.

	<p>
		Now, presumably I can look at formatting the static mesh part according to my
		custom layout, and adding normals and texture coordinates too. The animation
		part can come later, but I guess I can more or less copy how the simple BVH
		exporter works.
