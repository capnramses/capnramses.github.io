	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>Setting Up Unreal UDK</h2>

	<p>
		I'm trying out the Unreal Development Kit for a project. I'm just going to add some notes to this page every
		now and again. You may be on this page because you're looking for my previous post about debuggers on Linux.
	</p>

	<h3>The Blasted Proxy</h3>

	<p>
		Distribution has not considered organisation-wide proxy servers, which unfortunately are still a real thing in
		2015. Official docs suggest that you ask your IT people to add *epicgames to the exception list [chortles].
	</p>

	<p>
		To get around this you can download and build the source from Epic's github page. There is a
		<tt>setup.bat</tt> that needs to download a large wad of files. You can feed this a proxy address with:
	</p>

	<p>
		<tt>Setup.bat -proxy=http://my.proxy.address.here:port</tt>
	</p>

	<h3>Visual Studio 2013</h3>

	<p>
		The <tt>GenerateProjectFiles.bat</tt> claims to require VS2012, 2013, or 2015.
		I had 2012 installed and tried 2015 next - both were too much hassle. It's
		primarily set up for 2013 - use 2013. Check the VS install options and be sure
		that the C++ build packages and MFC (Microsoft Foundation Classes) are selected
		.
	</p>

	<h3>Compiling</h3>

	<p>
		Compiling the source code for the Editor project went very smoothly. It said it
		would take a up to 45 minutes. I had to leave it compiling over night. By
		comparison, my 20k line 3d game project rebuilds in just over 1 second. This is
		by far the biggest project I've ever built. Does it do enough to justify the
		size? We'll see! I hope so.
	</p>

	<h3>Buy a New PC</h3>

	<p>
		Going through the editor tutorials I notice that my (fairly new) work machine
		just can't cope - it's incredibly sluggish to do basic editor tasks. Changing
		textures or materials can incur up to a minute wait. The modern engine model
		of building a new shader for every slightly different material property or
		setting means that even trivial scenes require up to a thousand shaders to
		be built. This takes a huge amount of time even on better PCs than mine.
	</p>

	<h3>Quake-like Engine</h3>

	<p>
		Using the level editor brings back a lot of fond memories of playing with the
		Quake editor in the 90s. I'm somewhat surprised to see that BSP (binary space
		partition) brushes are still the main prefabs, as a lot of scene management
		design in graphics has moved to other ideas lately. The Doom/Quake/etc. engines
		were very quick to work with in editor, and had a very slow BSP and lighting
		compliation stage before you could test them in game. There's no obvious BSP
		compilation phase any more but there are certainly lighting build phases.
	</p>

	<h3>Swarm</h3>

	<p>
		An external process launches to compute lighting builds. I'm going to take a
		wild guess and assume that "swarm" is a parallel processor using CUDA or OpenCL
		or something. Interestingly, you can choose from a number of detail levels to
		build your light model with - "production" build presumably takes a lot longer,
		and you'd use the less accurate models to keep your workflow at a reasonable
		pace. This as far as I've got so far - Swarm hangs on my machine at about 96%
		built. I might try to get a faster machine.
