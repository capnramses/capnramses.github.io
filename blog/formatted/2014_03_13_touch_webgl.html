	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>Touch Screens with WebGL</h2>

	<p>
		At my visit to U.o.Hull last week Tim McMullen showed me his WebGL terrain
		simulation using Dart, and tried it out on a <u>massive</u> touch screen
		display with all the usual swipe and multi-touch recognition. He also pointed
		out that this would work directly on Android devices, which is a very nice
		idea indeed, because it means that I can abandon my port from WebGL to Android
		ADK/NDK entirely, and just use WebGL for everything! I absolutely loathe
		Android's development kit, and I really like WebGL, so this is fantastic news.
		Anyway, I tried it out and it works. Apparently you can get an array of touch
		events for adding
		<a

			support</a>,
		so I'll have to try that too. Using the
		mouse events as touch events didn't work very well for me in the past, given
		the range of controls that I had, so hopefully this will be better.
