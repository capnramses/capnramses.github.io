	<h2>My <tt>apg_bmp</tt> Mini-Library</h2>

	<p>You can find my current library's code in my <a href="https://github.com/capnramses/apg">apg</a> repository.</p>

	<h3>Used in Basis Universal</h3>

	<p>
		This week Binomial LLC adopted my little BMP image loader library into <a
			href="https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal">Basis Universal</a>, which is a Google partner project.
		Basis Universal is a <i>supercompression</i> GPU image compression system, and introduces a new <tt>.basis</tt>
		intermediate image format. It is also a suite of image converter and compression tools.
		Initially targeting video games, where "texture" images make up the bulk of a game's data, it now has interesting
		tie-ins to web technology, and if widely adopted,
		may end up producing a successor to the venerable JPEG, and other web-delivered image and video content. In prior
		releases Basis Universal only supported PNG images as inputs.
		Here is a <a href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/03/google-and-binomial-partner-to-open.html">Google blog
			post</a> from 20 March 2020, which provides more information.

	<h3>Background to <tt>apg_bmp</tt> Development</h3>

	<p>
		I maintain a <i>ToDo</i> list of interesting play-around side projects, and I try to knock out one or two every week
		as practice.
		One of those was <i>"Hey, I've never manually loaded an old-school Windows bitmap (BMP) image before, how does that
			work?"</i>.
	</p>

	<p>
		I ended up doing fairly well at loading a range of different sub-formats of BMP image in my little demo. I
		discovered that actually
		most professionally-used BMP loaders couldn't handle as many formats as I was testing with, which included some
		strange old bit-encoded variants, which I
		dug up from old internet archives from my own curiosity. A few benchmarks showed that I was actually loading faster
		than the popular libraries I was testing against.
		I was chatting about that on <a href="https://twitter.com/capnramses">Twitter</a>, and it provoked some interest.

		<small>Really old BMP images that look like pointillism artworks were very interesting. I was quite happy when I
			cracked the formula for loading these. I had to use a hex editor to work out the real formats used, as the
			specification documents often disagreed with
			the common implementations. This, and similar BMP images, can be found <a

	<h3>Fuzzing and Licences</h3>

	<p>
		Partner projects have to be extremely strict about use of licences for third-party software. Commercial software
		should be too, but they often avoid audit!
		I usually dual-licence my free and open source utility software because there's a great benefit to being flexible
		for yourself - it's ridiculous having to reinvent and reimplement your own utilities every time you change jobs.
		Really, companies should be more open to releasing things open source. But since they are not, if I dual-licence my
		own work with both a suitable open source licence, and an optional public domain declaration, then I have the
		flexibility to take that to any job I work on, and be much more productive with my time.
		I was able to set up licence options for my mini-libraries that made them easy to incorporate in other projects.
		Most imaging libraries have some technicality or other that makes that difficult.
	</p>

	<p>
		Google requires all its work to be fuzzed. It's a good idea to do this with any software that loads user-provided
		content, such as an image loader. I have recently been educated on fuzzers by my friend Saija, who is a security
		professional who has worked for some
		pretty major companies. Fuzzers are programs that take a set of inputs you provide and generate pseudo-random
		permutations of those, trying to find invalid files that make your program crash or become unstable. It doesn't take
		very long to generate a huge folder of
		images that blow up your program in interesting ways. Saija fuzzed <tt>apg_bmp</tt> with AFL, which let me easily
		reproduce issues and fix a huge number of surprising bugs. After fixing and re-fuzzing, if it reports no issues you
		can try seeding it with a new test
		set. You can be pretty confident then that your software has been hardened to handle both invalid or corrupted
		source images, as well as deliberately malicious files. It's like having the most persistent and evil QA tester ever
		working around the clock ruining your day!
		Most image loaders are not fuzzed, which kind of left me in a nice position of being a kind of winner-by-default for
		use in security-conscious applications. I tried the previous crashing results on popular image loaders (libraries
		and software). Almost all of them
		crashed. Some were very robust, but none supported as wide a range of BMP sub-formats. I got some really wild
		outputs between default image viewers for different platforms and the tools file explorers use to produce
		thumbnails. They mostly didn't crash, but they generated
		some bizarre output images. Oddly it seems they don't all use the same BMP reading code on the same operating
		systems.

	<p>If you're wondering about how to get started with fuzzers and fuzzing I am just about to publish a book
		<i>Professional Programing Tools for C and C++</i> with my friend Katja. It has a whole chapter on getting started
		with fuzzing.
		I may also do a tutorial stream in the next week or two.</p>

	<h3>Next Steps</h3>

	<p>Let's see what a very large user base reports in terms of bugs and feature requests! I would also like to attack my
		mini-lib with some different fuzzing tools. There were a few BMP features I didn't implement support for because I
		couldn't find real examples of
		them being used, so let's wait and see if people ask about it.</p>
