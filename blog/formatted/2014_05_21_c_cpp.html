	<h1>Anton's Research Ramblings</h1>
	<h2>Why C is Better than C++</h2>

	<p>
		To be clear, when I say "better", I mean universally, for all purposes,
		superior. Sometimes there are short-cuts in C++, so that it might be quicker to
		write mostly C, but compile with the C++ compiler. This can be handy for quick
		prototypes. The short-cuts aren't usually that much shorter though, and newer
		versions of the C standard do tend to adopt such things eventually.
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			C is small. Ritchie and Kernighan explain in "The C Programming Language"
			that a programmer can maintain a working knowledge of the entire language.
			That being the official reference book, which is only about 250 pages long.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you can programme in C you can read anyone else's C code because there's
			really only one style.
		</li>
		<li>
			It takes exactly one year to go from zero knowledge to mastery of C.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		In short; C is concise, which is not to be under-estimated as a key language
		feature. There are some few conventions that are a little more
		ponderous and formal than they need to be...which leads to temptation...
	</p>

	<p>
		I don't need to list the disadvantages of using C++. The short version is that
		it's too big to learn in its entirety (especially if you consider the vast range
		of eccentric styles and design patterns), and extremely prone to <u>over-engineering</u>.
		This means that it's time-consuming to write and to maintain, and hard to read.
	</p>
