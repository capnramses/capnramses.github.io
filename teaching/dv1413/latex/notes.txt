what is latex and what isn't it?

example documents - research paper, report/thesis

what goes in them?
-style/header
-sections

how to generate a .pdf or .ps
compile passes

how to include graphics

rules of thumb
-good for large documents - separate parts and include (theses, books).
-good for consistent style
-good for professional/academic layout
-good for mathematical formulae printing
-bad for "publisher" style where arrangement of objects on page is important
-bad for idiots and non-geeks
-can also be used for presentations, posters, etc.
(by TeXsperts (LaTeX nerds)).
-usually required for scientific publications
(they give you the 'style' file for their book/proceedings)

general approach
- start with a template or an existing document
- choose document type (1-2 column, a4)
- write \section{headings}
- add some notes
- include diagrams
- add maths
- add references and content paragraphs

* rebuild every page or so
* tinker with layout after finishing entire document
* have a web browser open to find tips
