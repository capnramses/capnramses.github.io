		This book presents a quick start to a full range of tools you can use for programming and shipping quality software
		written in the C or C++ programming languages. Each chapter addresses an important program development task, and
		introduces tools for completing the task on all the major desktop operating systems. We try to minimise the
		discussion, and get you started right away with practical instructions. Chapters have a section on <b>Tips and
			Common Problems</b> at
		the end.

	<p>In Chapter 4 <i>Interactive Debuggers</i> we learn how to make good use of command-line and visual
		debuggers, as well as the on-paper concept of a <i>walk</i> through your code, to understand the causes of errors in
		your program.</p>

	<p>In Chapter 2 <i>Writing Out an Image File</i> we add some colour to our programs by understanding how
		computers work with images,
		and find out it's not so difficult to do even for beginner programmers! We write out a binary image file that can
		open in graphics software, and then
		in
		Chapter 3 <i>Binary Files and Hex Editors</i>
		we work with a tool called a <i>hex editor</i> that lets us view the contents of the file to diagnose problems, and
		edit it manually.

<h1>About the Authors</h1>

<img src="images/authors.png" width="512" alt="Cartoon illustration of the authors." />

<h3><a href="https://antongerdelan.net/">Anton Gerdelan</a></h3>
<p>I am a computer graphics programmer, living in Ireland. I earned a PhD in Computer Science from Massey University in
	New Zealand. I wrote a graphics book called <a href="https://antongerdelan.net/opengl/">Anton's OpenGL 4
		Tutorials</a>, which surprised me when it immediately became
	very popular. I worked for an Augmented Reality headset company called Daqri, which involved working with a lot of
	different engineers in offices around the world, and coordinating our work remotely for some pretty fantastic
	technology. I've done quite a bit of lecturing at universities, and make video games as a hobby.</p>

<h3>Katja Žibrek</h3>
<p>I am a researcher in graphics, currently residing in France and working at the Inria research institute. I studied
	Psychology at the University of Ljubljana, Slovenia, where I got introduced to Virtual Reality as a potential tool to
	study people. I needed to know more about graphics, so I continued with a PhD in Computer Science at Trinity College
	Dublin, Ireland. Because of my suspicious social science background it is probably better I stayed away from writing
	any parts of the book but I made some pretty pictures.</p>
