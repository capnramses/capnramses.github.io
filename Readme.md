# My Website

## TODO

* put all the demos into a page with an index html table and give them numbered folder names so i don't go insane keeping track of them.
* consider a blog wipe/redo in less bloggy and more pithy/QED demo-ey format.
* regenerate sitemap. -perhaps put into .sh?
* maybe remove and rethink teaching notes/slides etc.

e.g. put everything in similar format to opengl stuff:
```
/demos/index.html
/demos/000_the_thing/

/slides/index.html
/slides/000_some_topic/

/docs/index.html    -- publications and whitepapers
/docs/000_some_pdf/
```
